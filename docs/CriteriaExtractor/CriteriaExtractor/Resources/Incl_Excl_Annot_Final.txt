Brief Summary :   
This study was designed to evaluate the safety and effi cacy of neoadjuvant and adjuvant atezolizumab in 
participants with resectable Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of two 
21-day cycles with atezolizumab. Following surgery ,  adjuvant therapy consisted of up to 12 months of 
atezolizumab in participants who demonstrate clinical benefit with neoadjuvant therapy. All participants 
who undergo surgery entered a surveillance period ,  which consisted of standardized blood sample 
collection and Chest CT Scans ,  for up to 2 years. All parti cipants were monitored for disease recurrence 
and survival for up to 3 years after last dose of study drug.

Secondary Outcome Measures !  :  
1. Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  
(RECIST) Version 1.1 [ Time Frame :  After surgery (approximately 10 weeks) ]  
Objective response rate is the proportion of participants who are objective responders 
(Complete Response and Partial Response are considered as responders ,  Stable Disease ,  
Progressive Disease and Not Evaluable are considered as nonresponders) in the PD -L1 
positive (TC123IC123) and negative (TC0IC0) groups.  
2. Percentage of Participants With Major Pathologic Response Rates For Programmed Death  
Ligand 1 (PD -L1)-Positive Versus PD -L1-Negative Participants [ Time Frame :  After surgery  
(approximately 10 weeks) ]  
Major pathologic response (defined as  <=  10% of viable tumor cells) ,  scored by a pathologist ,  
based on surgical resection as defined by prior studies.  
3. Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events [ Time Frame :  From Baseline until 90 days 
after end of treatm ent (approximately 16.5 months overall) ]

1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON NON -SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In the United States about 
200 , 000 cases are diagnosed each year with approximately 150 , 000 deaths occurring 
and a progressive increase in mortality with a ge (Siegel et al. 2015). Non -small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers and is divided into 
squamous cell carcinoma ,  large cell carcinoma ,  and adenocarcinoma subtypes.  The 
majority of patients present with advanced m etastatic disease that cannot be cured with 
current therapies.  A minority of patients (about 25%) present with localized disease that 
is sometimes (about 50%) cured by surgical resection.  Of those not cured by surgical 
resection ,  the majority recur in di stant sites that could not be detected prior to surgical 
resection. For these Stage IB
 IIIA patients ,  the addition of systemic chemotherapy 
before or after surgery improved 5 -year survival rates by about 5% (Pignon et al. 2008).  
Chemotherapy before surger y (neoadjuvant) results in slightly higher response rates 
compared to chemotherapy for advanced stages but there are essentially no complete 
responses (CRs).  Recently ,  immunotherapy with antibodies that bind to checkpoint 
inhibitors such as programmed dea th 1 (PD -1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
have been shown to produce long lasting responses in some patients with advanced 
NSCLC who were refractory to standard chemotherapy (Rizvi et al. 2015).   
Subsequent randomized clinical trials showed that t hese antibodies produce superior 
survival compared to docetaxel chemotherapy in patients who progressed after systemic 
platinum doublet chemotherapy (Borghaei et al. 2015; Brahmer et al. 2015;  
Fehrenbacher et al. 2016).  The clinical benefits were greater  in patients with high PD -L1 
expression although survival was similar to docetaxel even in patients lacking PD -L1 
expression. Early studies with these antibodies in the first line therapy setting showed  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 26
/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  even better results especially in patients with high PD-L1 expression (Gettinger 2015; 
Garon et al. 2015). Because PD -L1 expression is a continuous variable and not a perfect 
predictive biomarker ,  many investigators are exploring other potential biomarkers of 
predictive therapeutic benefit.  The number of mu tations determined by whole -exome 
sequencing (WES) has been shown to perform as another potential predictive biomarker 
(Rizvi et al. 2015). The expression of many other genes and proteins is being explored ,  
but this is complicated by the lack of tissue and  a limited understanding of its association 
with objective response rates (ORR) and survival.  
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMAB  
PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that downregulates immune responses primarily in 
peripheral tissues through binding to its two receptors PD -1 and B7.1. PD -1 is an 
inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T -cell activation ,  which is sustained in  
states of chronic stimulation such as in chronic infection or cancer (Blank et al. 2005; 
Keir et al. 2008). Binding of PD -L1 with PD -1 inhibits T -cell proliferation ,  cytokine 
production ,  and cytolytic activity ,  leading to the functional inactivation or ex haustion of  
T cells.  B7.1 is a molecule expressed on antigen -presenting cells and activated T 
cells.  PD -L1 binding to B7.1 on T cells and antigen -presenting cells can mediate 
downregulation of immune responses ,  including inhibition of T -cell activation and 
cytokine production (Butte et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2011).  
Overexpression of PD -L1 on tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment has been 
reported to impede anti -tumor immunity ,  resulting in immune evasion (Blank and 
Mackensen 2007).  Therefore ,  interr uption of the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway represents an 
attractive strategy to reinvigorate tumor -specific T -cell immunity.  
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq
  ,  formerly MPDL3280A) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and tw o light chains (214 
amino acids) ,  and is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  Atezolizumab was 
engineered to eliminate Fc -effector function via a single amino acid substitution at 
position 298 on the heavy chain ,  which results in a non -glycosylated an tibody that has 
minimal binding to Fc receptors and prevents Fc -effector function at expected 
concentrations in humans.  Atezolizumab targets human PD -L1 and inhibits its 
interaction with its receptors ,  PD -1 and B7.1 (CD80 ,  B7 -1).  Both of these interactio ns 
are reported to provide inhibitory signals to T cells.  Direct targeting of PD -L1 leaves 
the PD -L2-PD-1 interaction intact ,  potentially avoiding effects on immune 
homoeostasis.  
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq
 ) is approved for the treatment urothelial carcinoma ,  non
 small 
cell lung cancer  ,  small -cell lung cancer ,  triple -negative breast cancer ,  hepatocellular carcinoma ,  
and melanoma.

1.2.1 Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical strategy of the atezolizumab program was to demonstrate in vitro and 
in vivo activity ,  to determine in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior ,  to demonstrate an 
acceptable safety profile ,  and to identify a Phase  I starting dose.  Comprehensive 
pharmacology ,  PK ,  and toxicology evaluations were thus undertaken with 
atezolizumab.  
The safety ,  pharmacokinetics ,  and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab were investigated in 
mice and cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous ( IV) administration and to aid in 
projecting the appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the similar binding of 
atezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and human PD -L1 ,  the cynomolgus monkey was 
selected as the primary and relevant nonclinical model for unde rstanding the safety ,  
pharmacokinetics ,  and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab.  
Overall ,  the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for atezolizumab 
supported entry into clinical studies ,  including providing adequate safety factors for the 
proposed Phase I starting doses.  The results of the toxicology program were 
consistent with the anticipated pharmacologic activity of downmodulating the PD -
L1/PD -1 pathway and supported entry into clinical studies in patients.  
Refer to the Atezolizumab Inve stigator s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.  
1.2.2  Clinical Experience with Atezolizumab  
Atezolizumab clinical data are available from multiple Phase I ,  II ,  and III studies ,  both

1.2.2.1  Clinical Safety  
Single -Agent Clinical Safety in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer in 
Study PCD4989g  
Study PCD4989g is a Phase Ia dose escalation and expansion study ,  in which 
atezolizumab is being used  as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors or hematologic malignancies ,  and provides significant data 
(with 629 safety -evaluable patients across all cancer types as of the data cutoff date of 
15 December 2015) for the s afety profile of atezolizumab as monotherapy.  
Currently ,  no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) ,  no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) ,  and 
no clear dose -related trends in the incidence of adverse events have been determined.  
The safety profile of atezolizumab as a single agent is observed to be consistent 
across different indications ,  including small -cell lung cancer ,  NSCLC ,  urothelial bladder 
cancer (UBC) ,  renal cell carcinoma (RCC) ,  melanoma ,  gastric cancer ,  colorectal 
cancer ,  head and neck cancer ,  breast cancer ,  and sarcoma.   
Of the 629 patients across all cancer types in Study PCD4989g ,  619 patients (98.4%) 
experienced at least one adverse event ,  including 444 patients (70.6%) who 
experienced one treatment -related adverse event.  Commonly reported events (report ed 
in 
10% of all patients) included fatigue ,  nausea ,  decreased appetite ,  diarrhea ,  
constipation ,  dyspnea ,  pyrexia ,  and cough (see Table 1 ). 
A total of 89 safety -evaluable patients with NSCLC received atezolizumab in  
Study PCD4989g.  A total of 88 patient s (98.9%) experienced at least one adverse event ,  
including 67 patients (75.3%) with treatment -related adverse events ,  35 (39.3%) patients 
with Grade 3
 4 adverse events ,  36 patients (40.4%) with serious adverse events ,  5 
patients (5.6%) who discontinued st udy drug due to an adverse event ,  and 1 death 
(1.1%).  
The safety profile of the NSCLC cohort was consistent with the overall safety profile of 
all safety -evaluable patients in Study PCD4989g ,  as well as with the safety -evaluable 
patients with NSCLC who rec eived atezolizumab monotherapy in other studies.

As of the 1 December 2015 data cutoff date ,  142 patients with NSCLC were treated with 
atezolizumab as a fixed dose of 1200 mg IV q3w and 135 patients were treated with 
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV q3w in Study GO28753.  The frequency of patients with any 
reported  adverse event regardless of attribution was 96% in both arms.  Fewer patients 
in the atezolizumab arm (41%) experienced Grade 3

As of the 1 December 2015 data cutoff date ,  659 patients with NSCLC have been 
treated with atezolizumab as a fixed dose of 1200 mg IV q3w.  In Study GO28754 ,  
93.8% patients experienced at least one adverse event ,  65% of patients 
experienced one treatment -related adverse event ,  and 12% of patients experienced

Single -Agent Clinical Safety in Patients with Non -Small Cell  Lung Cancer in 
Study GO28915 (OAK)  
As of the July 2016 data cutoff date ,  609 patients with NSCLC were treated with 
atezolizumab as a fixed dose of 1200 mg IV q3w and 578 patients were treated with 
docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV q3w in Study GO28915.  Fewer patients in the atezolizumab arm 
(37%) expe rienced Grade 3
 4 adverse events compared with the docetaxel arm (54%).  
For Grade 3
 4 adverse events that were assessed as treatment -related ,  the difference 
was greater between the two arms (15% vs. 43% ,  respectively).  Rates of immune -
mediated adverse ev ents were low in patients treated with atezolizumab
 pneumonitis 
(1%) ,  hepatitis (0.3%) ,  and colitis (0.3%).  Adverse event -related discontinuation rates 
were 8% with atezolizumab arm vs. 19% for docetaxel arm.  
For additional information ,  refer to the Atezo lizumab Investigator s Brochure.  
Single -Agent Clinical Safety in Patients Undergoing Surgery  
Based on the mechanism of action and known safety profile of atezolizumab ,  no major 
complications (pre or post -surgery) are anticipated. The most commonly reported  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 32
/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  immune -mediated events with atezolizumab are dermatologic reactions and laboratory 
abnormali ties (changes in liver function tests and thyroid function tests). Given the 
protocol design ,  short timeframe from atezolizumab administration to surgery ,  and the 
known longer time to onset of such events ,  these events are considered unlikely in the 
Neoadj uvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase of this study (see Section 1.3). 
1.2.2.2  Clinical Activity  
Anti-tumor activity ,  including Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 
(RECIST v1.1) -based responses ,  have been observed in patients with different  tumor 
types (including NSCLC ,  RCC ,  melanoma ,  gastric cancer ,  UBC ,  colorectal cancer ,  
head and neck cancer ,  breast cancer ,  and sarcoma) treated with atezolizumab in Study 
PCD4989g.  
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator s Brochure for details on clinical a ctivity in all 
patients treated to date ,  regardless of tumor type.  
Single -agent data from Studies PCD4989g and GO28754 (BIRCH) ,  and data from the 
randomized Study GO28753 (POPLAR) in patients with advanced NSCLC are 
summarized below.  
Single -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study PCD4989g  
As of the 02 December 2014 cutoff date ,  88 patients with NSCLC in Study PCD4989g 
who received their first dose of atezolizumab by 21 October 2013 were evaluable for 
efficacy.  The media n age was 60.5 years; the group represented a heavily pre -treated 
patient population.  RECIST responses (confirmed) were observed in 20 of 88 (22.7%) 
patients ,  inclusive of squamous and non -squamous histologies and across all 
treatment cohorts (treatment d ose levels :  1 to 20 mg/kg).  A total of 8 of the 20 
responding patients have continued to respond at the time of the clinical data cutoff.  
Single -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study GO28753 (POPLAR)  
In Study GO28753  (POPLAR) ,  demographic characteristics were comparable between 
the atezolizumab and docetaxel treatment arms in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population.  
The median age was 62 years in both treatment arms ,  and the majority of patients had 
one prior therapy (6 5% for atezolizumab and 67% for docetaxel) ,  non -squamous 
histology (66% for atezolizumab and 66% for docetaxel) ,  and Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 (68% for atezolizumab and 68% for 
docetaxel).  More females were enrolled  in the docetaxel arm (35% vs. 47%).  
At the primary analysis on 8 May 2015 ,  there were 287 efficacy -evaluable patients (ITT 
population) ,  143 in the docetaxel arm and 144 in the atezolizumab arm. Median OS was 
12.6 months for atezolizumab compared with 9.7 months for docetaxel (HR of 0.73; 95%  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 33
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  CI :   0.53 ,  0.99).  Increasing improvement in OS was associated with increasing PD -L1 
expression.  Survival was similar to docetaxel in patients lacking PD -L1 expression and 
improved with atezolizumab in both responders  and non -responders.  Progression -free 
survival (PFS) and ORR were similar between the two treatment arms in the ITT 
population (Fehrenbacher et al. 2016).  
Single -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study GO28754 (BIRCH)  
In the BIRCH study ,  659 PD -L1-selected patients with advanced NSCLC were 
treated with atezolizumab; 139 patients were naive to prior chemotherapy (Cohort 1)  
and 520 patients had received at least one prior platinum -based chemotherapy 
regimen (Cohorts 2 and 3).  ORR was 19% in Cohort 1 and 17% in the other two 
cohorts.  The majority of responses were ongoing and duration of response and OS 
data were not mature  (Besse et al. 2015).  
Single -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer 
in Study GO28915 (OAK)  
In the OAK study ,  demographic characteristics were comparable between the 
atezolizumab and docetaxel treatment arms in the ITT populati on.  The majority of 
patients had one prior therapy (75% in both arms) ,  non -squamous histology (74% in 
both arms) ,  history of tobacco use (80% for atezolizumab and 83% for docetaxel) ,  and 
ECOG Performance Status of 1 (64% for atezolizumab and 62% for docet axel).   
At the primary analysis ,  there were 850 efficacy -evaluable patients (ITT 
population) :   425 in the docetaxel arm and 425 in the atezolizumab arm. Median 
OS in the ITT population was 13.8 months for atezolizumab compared with 9.6 
months for docetaxe l (HR of 0.73; 95% CI :  0.62 ,  0.87 ,  p
 0.0003).  OS benefit was 
seen regardless of PD -L1 expression (HR of 0.75 in
 1% PD -L1 expression 
population;  
0.41 in 
 50% tumor cell or 
 10% immune cell expression population) and was 
consistent across subgroups ,  includ ing histology (HR of 0.73 for both) ,  in patients with 
asymptomatic central nervous system metastases (HR of 0.54) and never smokers 
(HR of 0.71). PFS and ORR were similar between the two treatment arms in the ITT 
population (Rittmeyer et al. 2017).  
1.2.2.3  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  
On the basis of available preliminary PK data (0.03
 20 mg/kg) ,  atezolizumab appeared 
to show linear pharmacokinetics at doses 
 1 mg/kg.  For the 1 -mg/kg and 20 -mg/kg dose 
groups ,  the mean apparent clearance and  the mean volume of distribution under steady -
state conditions had a range of 3.20 to 4.44 mL/kg and 48.1 to 65.7 mL/kg ,  respectively ,  
which is consistent with the expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in humans.   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 34
/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  Development of anti -therapeutic antibodies ( ATAs) has been observed in patients in all 
cohorts in Study PCD4989g and was associated with changes in PK (namely ,  a 
reduction of atezolizumab C min to below the PK assay lower limit of quantification) ,  in 
some patients in the lower dose cohorts (0.3 ,  1 ,  a nd 3 mg/kg).  The development of 
detectable ATAs has not had a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from 
10 to 20 mg/kg.  Patients dosed at the 10 - ,  15- ,  and 20 -mg/kg dose levels have 
maintained the expected target trough levels of drug despite  the detection of ATAs.  To 
date ,  no clear relationship between the detection of ATAs and adverse events ,  infusion 
reactions ,  or efficacy has been observed.  
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT  
It is hypothesized that administration of atezolizu mab ,  an engineered IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody targeting PD -L1 ,  will demonstrate a good safety profile and produce objective 
responses in clinical Stage IB -IIIA NSCLC ,  especially in tumors which express PD -L1 
prior to resection. PD -L1 expression by tumor and immune cells results in impaired 
anti-tumor immune responses by inhibiting T -cell proliferation ,  cytokine production ,  and 
cytotoxic activity. As a result there is significant interest in developing therapeutics to 
block the immunosuppressive effects of PD -L1 and to identify patients who will benefit 
from this treatment strategy.  
While the addition of adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy following surgical resection 
of early stage NSCLC has produced significant survival benefits (Pignon et al. 2008) ,  
rates  of local and distant disease relapse leading to death remain unacceptably high. 
Studies show that neoadjuvant chemotherapy has approximately the same benefit as 
adjuvant (Felip et al. 2010).  Thus ,  it is critical to investigate the use of atezolizumab and  
similar agents in treating early stage resectable disease where one can assess the 
immune environment before and after treatment. It is also critical to develop highly 
predictive biomarkers of benefit and to study the evolution of immune -related markers 
with treatment with atezolizumab.   
There will be two parts to this study :   the first part (Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy 
Phase) will evaluate the ability of atezolizumab ,  an engineered IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody targeting PD -L1 ,  to produce pathologic resp onses in the neoadjuvant setting 
in patients with early stage NSCLC who have a pretreatment biopsy.   
The subsequent resection of tumors from these patients will allow determination of 
pathologic response rates and potential predictive biomarkers from the pretreatment 
biopsy and evolution of cancer -/immune - related markers associated with response in 
the tumor biopsy specimen after treatment.   
The primary endpoint of the study will be major pathologic response rate (defined as 
  
10% of viable tumor cells) determined from the surgical resection (Hellmann et al. 
2014).  In addition ,  response rates according to RECIST v1.1 will be determined from  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 35
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  chest CT scans obtained before and after the atezolizumab therapy and before surgical 
resection.   
The Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase will only include patients with Stage IB ,  
II ,  IIIA ,  or selected IIIB disease and who are deemed suitable for surgi cal resection 
without metastatic disease but with sufficient material for initial biopsy to analyze 
biomarkers.  Clinical staging of NSCLC is based on computed tomography (CT) of the 
chest and upper abdomen ,  positron emission tomography (PET) and brain CT or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out metastatic disease and assess the 
potential for curative -intent resection.  Resection represents the best chance for 
prolonged survival for patients with non -advanced NSCLC.  
 
 
There are little data to guide the duration of adjuvant immunotherapy in lung cancer.  An 
ongoing Phase III study is evaluating 12 months of atezolizumab treatment after 
cisplatin -based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected Stage IB  - IIIA NSCLC 
with high PD -L1 expression.  Another Phase III study is currently recruiting patients with 
unresectable Stage III NSCLC to receive 1 year of consolidation anti -PD-1 therapy after 
definitive chemo -radiation.  Adjuvant immunotherapy has also been explored in  other 
solid tumors.  Adjuvant immunotherapy treatment for 1 year with interferon alfa -2b 
prolongs the relapse -free interval and OS of high -risk resected melanoma patients

at el. 2017).

During this phase of the study ,  patients will have their NSCLC assessed by CT scan of 
the chest (with IV contrast) ,  PET/CT ,  and brain MRI (preferably with gadolinium).  
  Brain 
imaging may be omitted for patients with clinical Stage IB tumors but should be obtained 
for patients with clinical Stages II ,  IIIA ,  and selected IIIB tumors.  If brain MRI is not 
feasible for technical or patient -related reasons (e.g. ,  pacemaker ,  severe claustrophobia) ,  
brain CT scan with IV contrast should be obtained. Tumor biop sy ,  whole blood samples ,  
 
will be obtained before  
Patients will receive two doses of atezolizumab administered 3 weeks apart before 
surgical resection.  Patients who have radiologic progression prior to the second dose 
will be discontinued from atezolizumab and the patient will not have surgical resection  as 
part of this study.  
Surgical Resection

3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
3.3.1  Rationale for Atezolizumab Dose and Schedule  
The fixed dose of 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight -based dose of  
15 mg/kg) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies described in  
Section 1.2.1 and available clinical data from Study PCD4989g as described below.  
The target exposure for atezolizumab was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue 
distribution  data in tumor -bearing mice ,  target -receptor occupancy in the tumor ,  the 
observed atezolizumab interim pharmacokinetics in humans ,  and other factors. The 
target trough concentration (C trough) was projected to be 6 
 g/mL on the basis of several 
assumptions ,   including the following :   1) 95% tumor -receptor saturation is needed for 
efficacy and 2) the tumor -interstitial concentration to plasma ratio is 0.30 based on tissue 
distribution data in tumor -bearing mice.  
The atezolizumab dose is also informed by availa ble clinical activity ,  safety ,  
pharmacokinetics ,  and immunogenicity data. Anti -tumor activity has been observed 
across doses from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg q21d.  The MTD of atezolizumab was not 
reached ,  and no DLTs have been observed at any dose in Study PCD498 9g. Currently 
available PK and ATA data suggest that the 15 -mg/kg atezolizumab q3w regimen (or 
fixed -dose equivalent) for Phase II and Phase III studies would be sufficient to both 
maintain C trough 
 6 
g/mL and further safeguard against both interpatient v ariability and 
the potential effect of ATAs that could lead to subtherapeutic levels of atezolizumab 
relative to the 10 -mg/kg atezolizumab q3w regimen (or fixed -dose equivalent).  From 
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
   
   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 49
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  inspection of available observed C trough data ,  moving further to the 20 -mg/kg 
atezolizumab q3w regimen does not appear to be warranted to maintain targeted C trough 
levels relative to the proposed 15 -mg/kg atezolizumab q3w level.  
Simulations (Bai et al. 2012) do not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in 
exposure fo llowing a fixed dose or a dose adjusted for weight.  Therefore ,  a fixed dose 
of 1200 mg has been selected (equivalent to an average body weight
 based dose of 
15 mg/kg).  Selection of an every -21-day dosing interval is supported by this 
preliminary PK evalu ation.  
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator s Brochure for details regarding nonclinical and 
clinical pharmacology of atezolizumab.  
3.3.2  Rationale for Patient Population  
While the addition of adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy following surgical resection 
of early stage NSCLC has produced significant survival benefits (Pignon et al. 2008) ,  
rates of local and distant disease relapse leading to death remain unacceptably high.  
Studies show that neoadjuvant chemotherapy has approximately the same benefit as 
adjuvant (Felip et al. 2010).  Recently ,  immunotherapy with antibodies that bind to 
checkpoint inhibitors such as PD -1 and PD -L1 have been shown to produce long lasting 
responses in some patients with advanced NSCLC who were refractory to standard 
chemotherap y (Brahmer et al. 2015).  Therefore this study population was chosen to 
primarily determine the ability of atezolizumab to produce objective responses in 
patients  
undergoing curative intent surgery for Stage IB -IIIA NSCLC.

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.1 SAFETY PLAN  
Atezolizumab is approved in the United States for the treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic UC.  The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience 
with atezolizumab in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated important sa fety 
risks for atezolizumab are outlined below.   
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study ,  
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
patients during the study.  Admin istration of atezolizumab will be performed in a 
monitored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate 
equipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions.  Guidelines for 
managing anticipated adverse events ,  inc luding criteria for dosage modification and 
treatment interruption or discontinuation ,  are provided below.  In addition ,  a pre -specified 
interim safety analysis will be conducted to evaluate the safety data during the study.  
5.1.1  Risks Associated with At ezolizumab  
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following :   infusion -related 
reactions and immune -related hepatitis ,  pneumonitis ,  colitis ,  pancreatitis ,  diabetes  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 73
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  mellitus ,  hypothyroidism ,  hyperthyroidism ,  adrenal insufficiency ,  hypophysi tis ,  Guillain -
Barre syndrome ,  myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis ,  meningoencephalitis ,  
myocarditis ,  nephritis  ,  myositis ,  and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Immune -mediated 
reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to hemophagocytic lym phohistiocytosis 
(HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) ,  which are considered to be potential risks 
for atezolizumab .   
Refer to Appendix 9 of the protocol and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's 
Brochure for a detailed description of anti cipated safety risks for atezolizumab.  
Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by an excessive immune 
response.  Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab ,  systemic immune activation 
is considered a potential risk when given in com bination with other immunomodulating 
agents.  Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for 
patients who ,  in the absence of an alternative etiology ,  develop a sepsis -like syndrome 
after administration of atezolizumab ,  and the initial evaluation should include the 
following :   
  CBC with peripheral smear  
  PT ,  PTT ,  fibrinogen ,  and D -dimer  
  Ferritin  
  Triglycerides  
  AST ,  ALT ,  and total bilirubin  
  LDH 
  Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly)  
If systemic immune activation is still suspected after the initial evaluation ,  contact the 
Medical Monitor for additional recommendations.  
5.1.2  Management of Patients Who Experi ence Specific Adverse  
Events   
Guidelines for management of patients who experience specific adverse events 
associated with atezolizumab ,  including infusion -related reactions and immune -related 
events (e.g. ,  myocarditis and pulmonary ,  hepatic ,  gastrointesti nal ,  endocrine ,  ocular ,  
pancreatic ,  dermatologic ,  neurologic ,  and renal events) ,  are provided in the Appendix 9 . 
5.1.2.1  Atezolizumab Dose Modification and Treatment Interruption  
Atezolizumab dose modification is not allowed in the Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab  
Therapy Phase.  The following rules apply :  1 ) if atezolizumab is interrupted during 
infusion due to reaction ,  but resumed ,  patient may proceed with all future study -related 
activities ,  2) if atezolizumab is held (e.g. ,  treatment is delayed) after first d ose due to 
tolerability concerns ,  the Investigator may choose to discontinue patient from study if 
medically indicated ,  3) if the patient receives less than prescribed dose of atezolizumab  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 74
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  (e.g. if infusion cannot be completed) ,  patient continuation in the  study will require 
Medical Monitor approval. If the patient does not discontinue from study ,  they may 
proceed as per protocol.  Investigator may contact Medical Monitor for further guidance.  
If the patient discontinues treatment ,  they will enter Survival  Follow -up ,  as specified in 
Section 4.6.  
Atezolizumab dose modification is not allowed during Adjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy 
Phase.  However ,  atezolizumab may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing 
toxicity considered to be related to atezolizum ab for up to 12 weeks after the last dose if 
they experience toxicity that require a dose to be withheld.  If atezolizumab is withheld 
because of toxicity for 
 12 weeks after the last dose ,  then the patient will be 
discontinued from atezolizumab treatment and will be followed for safety and efficacy as 
specified in Section 4.6. If a patient must be tapered off corticosteroids used to treat 
adverse events ,  atezolizumab may be held for 
 12 weeks after the last dose until 
corticosteroids are discontinued or re duced to prednisone dose of 
 10 mg/day (or 
equivalent).  
Dose interruptions for reasons other than toxicity (e.g. ,  surgical procedures) may be 
allowed ,  with Medical Monitor approval.  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will 
determine the acceptable le ngth of interruption.  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events associated with atezolizumab are 
provided in the Appendix 9 . 
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events ,  including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest ,  performing protocol -
specified safety laboratory assessments ,  measuring protocol -specified vital signs ,  and 
conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation 
of the study.  
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor ,  as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
5.2.1  Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline fo r Good Clinical Practice ,  an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product ,  regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following :   
  Any unfavora ble and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) ,  
symptom ,  or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product ,  
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 75
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing dis ease (a worsening in the 
character ,  frequency ,  or severity of a known condition) ,  except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.10  
  Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g. ,  headache) not present at 
baseline  
  Any deterioration in a laboratory value or ot her clinical test (e.g. ,  ECG ,  X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in atezolizumab treatment or 
concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug  
  Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention ,  including those 
that occur prior to assignment of atezolizumab treatment (e.g. ,  screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)  
5.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the  Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria :   
  Is fatal (i.e. ,  the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)  
  Is life threatening (i.e. ,  the adverse event ,  in the view of the investigator ,  places the 
patient at  immediate risk of death)  
 -  This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue might have caused death.  
  Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.11 ) 
  Results in persistent o r significant disability/incapacity (i.e. ,  the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)  
  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug  
  Is a s ignificant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g. ,  may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)  
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the  intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g. ,  rated as mild ,  moderate ,  or severe ,  or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]; see 
Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical signific ance (such as 
severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immed iately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).

/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  5.2.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to  
the Sponsor)  
See Appendix 10 for list of adverse events of special interest.  
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FOR CAPTURING AND ASSESSING SAFETY 
PARAMETERS  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in ,  Sections 5.4 ,  5.5 ,  and 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria) ,  severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ) ,  and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 
5.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All 
adverse events ,  (including the neoadjuvant phase ,  surgery phase ,  and adjuvant phase) 
whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel ,  will be recorded in  the 
patient s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.   
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug  ,  
only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g. ,  invasive 
procedures such as biopsie s ,  discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see 
Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).  
After initiation of study drug  ,  all adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the 
last dose of atezolizumab (neoadjuv ant or adjuvant ,  whichever occurs last).  Serious 
adverse events and non -serious adverse events of special interest will be reported until 
90 days after the last dose of atezolizumab (neoadjuvant or adjuvant ,  whichever occurs 
last). For patients participat ing in the Adjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase ,  as outlined 
in Section 3.1.4  ,  who will receive and complete SOC chemotherapy prior to adjuvant 
atezolizumab ,  all AE s will be reported from their first dose of neoadjuvant atezolizumab 
until 30 days after the  last dose of adjuvant atezolizumab. Additionally ,  serious adverse 
events and non -serious adverse events of special interest will be reported until 90 days 
after the last dose of adjuvant atezolizumab for these patients.

Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6. 
5.3.2  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adver se event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive 
questions include the following :   
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"  
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"  
5.3.3  Asses sment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity. Table 6 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

Instrumental activi ties of daily living refer to preparing meals ,  shopping for groceries or 
clothes ,  using the telephone ,  managing money ,  etc.  
b Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing ,  dressing and undressing ,  
feeding oneself ,  using the toilet ,  and ta king medications ,  as performed by patients who are 
not bedridden.  
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event , " it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions) ,  per the definition of serious 
adverse  event in Section 5.2.2 . 
d Grade 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting 
instructions) ,  per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 . 
5.3.4  Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators s hould use their knowledge of the patient ,  the circumstances surrounding 
the event ,  and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug ,  indicating "yes" or "no" 
according ly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 
7) :  
  Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug  
  Course of the event ,  with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction ,  
discontinuation of study drug ,  or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)  
  Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments  
  Known association  of the event with the disease under study  
  Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event  
  Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence  of the event   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 79
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Table 7  Causal Attribution Guidance  
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts ,  evidence ,  
science -based rationales ,  and clinical judgment?  
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug ,  and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient's clinical state ,  intercurrent illness ,  or concomitant therapies; a nd/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and ,  if applicable ,  reappears upon re -challenge.  
NO An adverse event will be  considered related ,  unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .   
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g. ,  preexisting medical condition ,  underlying disease ,  intercurrent illness ,  or 
concomitant medicati on); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g. ,  cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug).  
For patients receiving combination therapy ,  causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
5.3.5  Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
event s on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
5.3.5.1  Infusion -Related Reactions  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after treatment administration and are 
judged to be related to study treatment infusion (atezolizumab or docetaxel) should be captured 
as a diagnosis (e.g. ,  "infusion -related reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible ,  avoid 
ambiguous terms such as "syst emic reaction."   
Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction 
eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study 
treatment ,  each reaction should be recorded separatel y on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  with signs 
and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  
5.3.5.2  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
For adverse events ,  a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g. ,  record only liver failure or 
hepatitis rather than jaundice ,  asterixis ,  and elevated transaminases).  However ,  if a 
constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting ,  each individual event should be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established ,  all previousl y 
reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis ,  with a starting date that 
corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 80
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  5.3.5.3 Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events  
In general ,  adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g. ,  cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause ,  with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example :   
  If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult ,  
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.  
  If vomiting results in severe dehydration ,  both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.  
  If a severe gastrointes tinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure ,  both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
  If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture ,  all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
  If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection ,   both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
5.3.5.4  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent adverse  event is one that extends continuously ,  without resolution ,  between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time th e event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe ,  the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious ,  it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 
5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by 
changing the event from "non -serious" to "serious , " providing the date that the event 
became serious ,  and com pleting all data fields related to serious adverse events.  
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adve rse Event eCRF.  
5.3.5.5  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of 
the following criteria :   
  Is ac companied by clinical symptoms   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 81
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    Results in a change in atezolizumab treatment (e.g. ,  dosage modification ,  treatment 
interruption ,  or treatment discontinuation)  
  Results in a medical intervention (e.g. ,  potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change i n concomitant therapy  
  Is clinically significant in the investigator s judgment  
Note :   For oncology trials ,  certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events.  
It is the investigator s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant lab oratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome  
(e.g. ,  ALP and bilirubin 5 
 ULN associated with cholestasis) ,  only the diagnosis (i.e. ,  
cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is  not a sign of a disease or syndrome ,  
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g. ,  
"elevated potassium , " as opposed to "abnormal po tassium").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions ,  
the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example ,  an elevated 
serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded a s "hyperkalemia."  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.6  Abnormal V ital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of the 
following criteria :   
  Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
  Results in a change in atezolizumab treatment (e.g. ,  dosage modification ,  treatment 
interruption ,  or treatment discontinuation)  
  Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
  Is clinically significant in the investigator s judgment  
It is the investigator s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be class ified as an adverse event.   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 82
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g. ,  
high blood pressure) ,  only the diagnosis (e.g. ,  hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same cli nically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.7  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated  ALT or AST (
 3
baseline value) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin (
 2
ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by Hy's law).  Therefore ,  investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following :   
  Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 
 3
baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin 
 2
ULN (of which 
 35% is direct bilirubin)  
  Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 
 3
baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice  
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRF (see Section 5.3.5.2 ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event) ,  either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see 
Section 5.4.2 ). 
5.3.5.8  Deaths  
All deaths that occur  during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see  
Section 5.3.1 ) ,  regardless of relationship to study drug ,  must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of NSCLC.  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a di stinct event.  The event or 
condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the 
single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally ,  only one such event 
should be reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cann ot be ascertained at the 
time of reporting ,  "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g. ,  after autopsy) ,  "unexplained death" 
should be replaced by the established cause of death. Th e term "sudden death" should 
not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g. ,  "sudden cardiac 
death").  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g. ,  after autopsy) ,  "unexplained 
death" should be replaced by the established cause of death.   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 83
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  If the death is attributed to progression of NSCLC ,  this is the only case when "disease 
progression" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.   
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Sec tion 5.6. 
5.3.5.9  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting me dical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency ,  severity ,  or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexistin g condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g. ,  
"more frequent headaches").  
5.3.5.10  Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Deterioration that is judged by the investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity o r 
frequency or changed in nature (i.e. ,  deterioration beyond the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease) should be recorded as an adverse event.   
When recording an unanticipated worsening of non -small cell lung cancer on the  
Adverse Ev ent eCRF ,  it is important to convey the concept that the condition has  
changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g. ,  "accelerated worsening of non -small cell lung 
cancer").   
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression  of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events ,  unless death is the 
outcome (see Section 5.3.5.8 ).  These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data 
only.  In most cases ,  the expected pattern of progression will be based on RECI ST v1.1.  
In rare cases ,  the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic 
deterioration.  However ,  every effort should be made to document progression through 
use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an ev ent is due to 
disease progression/recurrence ,  it should be reported as an adverse event.  
5.3.5.11  Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e. ,  inpatient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ) ,  except as outlined 
below.   
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event :   
  Hospitalization for respite care   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 84
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g. ,  for s tudy drug administration)  
  Hospitalization for a preexisting condition ,  provided that all of the following criteria 
are met :   
The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progression of the disease  
The patient has not experienced an adverse event  
  Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer  
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event ,  but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead :   
  Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours  
5.3.5.12  Adverse Events Associated with an Accidental Overdose or 
Medication Error in Drug Administration  
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  Medication error :   Accidental deviation in the administration of a drug ,  
in some cases ,  a medication error may be intercepted prior to administrati on of the drug.  
An overdose or incorrect administration of atezolizumab treatment is not itself an adverse 
event ,  but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an 
overdose  ,  incorrect administration or medication error of study drug should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria or 
qualifies as an adverse event of special interest  ,  the event should be reported to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours aft er learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPONSOR  
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.   The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list 
of events that the investigator must report to  the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event ,  regardless of relationship to study drug :   
  Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)  
  Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)  
  Pregnancies (see S ection 5.4.3 for further details)  
For serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest ,  the investigator must report 
new significant follow -up information for these events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. ,   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 85
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant 
information includes the following :   
  New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
  Significant new diagnostic test results  
  Change in causality based on new information  
  Change in the event s outcome ,  including recovery  
  Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event  
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committee (EC).

5.4.2  Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and  
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
5.4.2.1  Events That Occur prior to Study Drug Initiation  
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug ,  only 
serious adverse events ca used by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided 
to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e. ,  no more t han 24 hours after learning of the event) ,  either by faxing or 
by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.  
5.4.2.2  Events That Occur after Study Drug Initiation  
After initiation of study drug ,  adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the last 
dose of atezolizumab (neoadjuvant or adjuvant ,  whichever occurs last).  See Table 5 for 
full details.  Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be 
reported until 90 days after t he last dose of atezolizumab (neoadjuvant or adjuvant ,  
whichever occurs last).  Only serious adverse events associated with CT scans ,  blood  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 86
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  sample collection and optional biopsy at the time of disease progression/recurrence that 
occur after the 90 day repo rting window ,  but during the Surveillance period ,  will be 
collected and reported (see Table 5 ). Investigators should record all case details that 
can be gathered immediately (i.e. ,  within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.  A report will be generated and sent to Safety Risk Management by the EDC 
system.  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable ,  the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse 
Event of Special Interest R eporting Form provided to investigators should be completed 
and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event) ,  either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using 
the fax number or em ail address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is 
available ,  all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.   
Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur 
 90 days after the last dose 
of atezolizumab are provided in Section 5.6. 
5.4.3  Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies  
5.4.3.1  Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed  
Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the 
study or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab .  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately  (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) ,  either by 
faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address 
provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  The investi gator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient ,  
discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring 
of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse 
events associated w ith the pregnancy (e.g. ,  an event in the fetus ,  an event in the mother 
during or after the pregnancy ,  or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be 
reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition ,  the investigator will submit a Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome 
of the pregnancy becomes available.   
5.4.3.2  Abortions  
A spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers 
abortions to be medicall y significant) ,  recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity ,  the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event ,  recorded on the  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 87
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Adverse Event eCRF ,  and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or elective abortion performed for reasons 
other than an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form.  
5.4.3.3  Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects and Abortions  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
drug should be classified as a serious adverse event ,  recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF ,  and reported to the Sponsor i mmediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  Any abortion should be reported in the same 
fashion (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant).  
5.4.4  Reporting Requirements for Special Situations and   
Non -Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Special  Situation  
After initiation of study drug ,  special situations and adverse events associated with special 
situations will be reported until 90 days after the final dose of study drug. Investigators 
should record all case details that can be gathered on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF and submit 
the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system within 30 calendar days of 
awareness. A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the 
EDC system.  
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENTS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.5.1  Investigator Follow -Up 
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline 
grade or better ,  the event is assessed as stable by the investigator ,  the patient is lost to 
follow -up ,  or the patient withdraws consent.  Every  effort should be made to follow all 
serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures 
until a final outcome can be reported.  
During the adverse event reporting period (defined in Section 5.3.1 ) ,  resolution of advers e events 
(with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient s medical 
record to facilitate source data verification.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  
5.5.2  Sponsor Follow -Up 
For serious adverse events ,  adverse events of special interest ,  and pregnancies ,  the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone ,  fax ,  electronic mail ,  and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g. ,  from 
hosp ital discharge summaries ,  consultant reports ,  autopsy reports) in order to perform 
an independent medical assessment of the reported case.   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 88
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVERSE EVENT 
REPORTING PERIOD  
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event or non -serious adverse event of special interest that occurs after the end 
of the adverse event  reporting period (defined as 90 days after the last dose of 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant atezolizumab ,  whichever occurs last; see Table 5 ) ,  if the event 
is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  These events should be reported 
through use of th e Adverse Event eCRF.  However ,  if the EDC system is not available ,  
the investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee ,  either 
by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of 
Special Interes t Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.  
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES ,   
INVESTIGATORS ,  INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS ,  AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES  
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse event s and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously 
communicate possible new safety findings to investigators ,  IRBs ,  ECs ,  and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.  
To determi ne reporting requirements for single adverse event cases ,  the Sponsor 
will assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference 
document :  
  Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure  
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cu mulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.  
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness ,  with allowance for upgra ding by the Sponsor as needed.  
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
The objective of this study is to determine if atezolizumab 1200 mg q21d demonstrates 
efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting by producing a major pathologic response rate of at 
least 15%; major pathologic response is defined as 
  10% of viable tumor cells 
(Hellmann et al. 2014).  Tumors without radiographic response ,  but which demonstrate a 
major pathologic response (Hellmann et al. 2014) will be counted as a response.  
Safety of atezolizumab in this treatment setting will also be assessed.  
Details of the anal yses are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY  
The number of patients who enroll ,  discontinue ,  or complete the study will be 
summarized.  Reasons for premature study withdrawal will be listed and summarized.  
Enrollment and major protocol deviations will be listed and evaluated for their potential 
effects on the interpretation of study results.  
6.3 SUMMARIES OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASELINE 
CHARACTERISTICS  
Demographic information such as age and race will be tabulated.  Descriptive statistics ,  
including means ,  standard deviations ,  and ranges for continuous p arameters ,  as well as 
percentages and frequencies for categorical parameters ,  will be presented.  Adverse 
events ,  Grade 3/4 adverse events ,  and serious adverse events will be tabulated.   
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all enrolled patients who have 
received at least one dose of the study drug and who do not have EGFR or ALK mutant 
tumors (efficacy population).  
6.4.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The effectiveness of the atezolizumab will be assessed by major pathologic response 
rate in the efficacy population ,  excluding patients who have not received surgery after 
neoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab.  A statistical test of a single proportion of 
major pathologic r esponse rate will be tested against the alternative that the rate is 15%.  
If the null hypothesis is rejected then this is evidence that the response rate exceeds 5% 
when atezolizumab is given before resection.  The one -sided 95% confidence interval 
(CI) f or major pathologic response will be reported.

6.7 INTERIM ANALYSES  
6.7.1  Planned Interim Analyses  
The interim analyses described below will be performed.  The study will continue during 
the interim analyses.  
6.7.1.1  Planned Interim Safety Analysis  
There is not yet extensive data on the safety of thoracic surgical resections after 
treatment with checkpo int inhibitors.  Therefore ,  after the first 30 patients who complete 
protocol -specified atezolizumab treatment and have undergone the planned surgical 
resection of their tumor ,  the patient cohort will be evaluated for tolerability and safety of 
the neoadju vant regimen.  If ,  at the time of the safety interim analysis ,  three or more 
patients have experienced Grade 5 adverse events related to protocol treatment ,  then 
the study will be discontinued.  
6.7.1.2  Planned Interim Efficacy Analysis  
The study includes o ne interim analysis to assess futility after 90 patients are assessed.  
The non -binding futility interim boundary satisfies conditional power at a cut -off of 0.30.  
6.7.2  Optional Interim Analyses  
Given the hypothesis -generating nature of this study ,  the S ponsor may choose to 
conduct additional interim efficacy analyses.  The decision to conduct an optional interim 
analysis ,  and the timing of the analysis ,  will be documented in the Sponsor s trial master

and interpreted by Sponsor study team personnel.  
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The Sponsor will supply eCRF specifications for this study A contract research 
organization (CRO) will be re sponsible for the data management of this study ,  including 
quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through 
use of eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event 
of discrepant data ,   the CRO will request data clarification from the sites ,  which the sites 
will resolve electronically in the EDC system.   
The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study.  The CRO will 
produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. Data will be periodically transferred electronically from th e CRO 
to the Sponsor ,  and the Sponsor s standard procedures will be used to handle and 
process the electronic transfer of these data.   
Central laboratory data will be sent directly to the Sponsor and/or CRO ,  using the 
Sponsor s and/or CRO s standard proce dures to handle and process the electronic 
transfer of these data.  
  
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data 
will be consistent with the Sponsor s standard procedures.  
7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE RE PORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites 
will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.   
eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in  
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor.  
All eCRFs should be completed by designated ,  trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  
At the end of the study ,  the investigator will  receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  
Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.  
   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 94
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source  data verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e. ,  source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are 
accurate ,  complete ,  and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and 
documented for the first time.  They include ,  but are not limited to ,  hospital records ,  
clinical and office charts ,  laboratory notes ,  memoranda ,  patient -reported outcom es ,  
evaluation checklists ,  pharmacy dispensing records ,  recorded data from automated 
instruments ,  copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate 
and complete ,  microfiche ,  photographic negatives ,  microfilm or magnetic media  ,  imaging ,  
patient files ,  and records kept at pharmacies ,  laboratories ,  and medico -technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.  
Before study initiation ,  the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Moni toring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e. ,  no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. 
To facilitate source data verification ,  the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct acces s to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related 
monitoring ,  Sponsor audits ,  and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow 
inspection by applicable health authorities.  
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS  
When clinical observations are entere d directly into a study site s computerized medical 
record system (i.e. ,  in lieu of original hardcopy records) ,  the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertain ing to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified ,  the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the or iginal data as well as the reason for the change ,  name of the person 
making the change ,  and date of the change.  
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP ,  including eCRFs ,  electronic PRO data (if applicable) ,  Informed Consent Forms ,  
laboratory test results ,  medication inventory records  ,  and images  ,  must be retained by the 
Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 95
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities ,  
whichever is longer.  After that period of time ,  the documents may be destroyed ,  subject 
to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Wri tten 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.  
The Sponsor will retain study data for 25 years after the final study results have been reported or 
for the length of  time required by relevant national or local health authorities ,  whichever is 
longer.

/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  MEASURABILITY OF TUMOR AT BASELINE  
DEFIN ITIONS  
At baseline ,  tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -
measurable as follows.  
a. Measurable Tumor Lesions  
Tumor Lesions.   Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension  
(longest diameter in the plane of  measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of :   
  10 mm by CT or MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 
mm) 
  10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
  20 mm by chest X -ray 
b. Non-Measurable Tumor Lesions  
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (lon gest diameter 
 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with 
 10 to 
 15 mm short axis) ,  as well as truly non -
measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal 
disease ,  ascites ,  pleural or pericardial effusion ,  inflammatory breast  disease ,  
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung ,  peritoneal spread ,  and abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not 
measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
c. Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Meas urability  
Bone lesions ,  cystic lesions ,  and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment ,  as outlined below.  
Appendix 6  
     Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
Bone lesions :   
  Bone scan ,  positron emission tomography (PET) scan ,  or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However ,  
these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone 
lesions.  
  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions ,  with identifiable soft tissue 
components ,  that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets the definitio n of measurability described above.  
  Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 125
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Cystic lesions :   
  Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since 
they are ,  by definition ,  simple cysts.  
  Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However ,  if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient ,  these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment :   
  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
TARGET LESIONS :   SPECIFICATIONS BY METHODS OF MEASUREMENTS 
a. Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements should b e recorded in metric notation ,  using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
b. Method of Assessment  
The s ame method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study.  Imaging -
based evaluation should always be the preferred option.  
Clinical Lesions.   Clinical lesions will be considered measurable only when they are 
superficial and 
 10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. ,  skin nodules).  For 
the case of skin lesions ,  documentation by color photography ,  including a ruler to 
estimate the siz e of the lesion is suggested.  
Chest X -Ray.   Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray ,  particularly when progression is 
an important endpoint ,  since CT is more sensitive than X -ray ,  particularly in identifying  Appendix 6  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 126
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6       Re 
new lesions.   However ,  lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
CT ,  MRI.   CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guide line has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan on the basis of the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  
When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm ,  the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness .  MRI is also acceptable.  
If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with IV 
contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency ,  the decision as to whether a non -
contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to  evaluate the patient at baseline 
and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the 
anatomic location of the disease.  For patients who develop contraindications to contrast 
after baseline contrast CT is done ,  the decision  as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI 
(enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type 
and the anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized to allow for 
comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each cas e should be discussed with the 
radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and ,  if not ,   
the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward .  Care must be 
taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality and interpretation of 
nontarget disease or new lesions since the same lesion may appear to have a different  
size using a new modality.  
Ultrasound.   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement.  
Endoscopy ,  Laparoscopy ,  Tumor Markers ,  Cytology ,  Histology.   The utilization of 
these techniques for objective  tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised.  
TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION  
ASSESSMENT OF OVERALL TUMOR BURDEN AND MEASURABLE 
DISEASE  
To assess objective response or future progression ,  it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for 
subsequent measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at 
least one measurable lesi on ,  as detailed above.  
BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON -TARGET LESIONS  
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline ,  all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 127
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  representative of all inv olved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be 
recorded and measured at baseline.  This means in instances where patients have 
only one or two  
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
organ sites involved ,  a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites) ,  
respectively ,  will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will 
be recorded as non -measurable lesions (even if the size is 
 10 mm by CT scan).  
Target lesions should b e selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs but ,  additionally ,  should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that ,  on 
occasion ,  the largest lesio n does not lend itself to reproducible measurement ,  in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by ima ging even if not involved by tumor.  As noted above ,  pathological 
nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet 
the criterion of a short axis of 
 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes 
will contribute  to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally 
used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally 
reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan ,  
this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial ,  
sagittal ,  or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example ,  an 
abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm
 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant ,  measurable node.  In this example ,  20 mm should be recorded 
as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 
 10 mm 
but 
 15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis 
10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
Lesions irradiated within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may not be counted as target 
lesions.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions ,  short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum ,  then ,  as noted above ,  only the short axis is added 
into the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a refere nce to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) ,  including pathological lymph nodes ,  should be  
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at ba seline.  Measurements  Appendix 6  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 128
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  are not required and these lesions should be followed as  present ,    absent ,   or in rare  
cases  unequivocal progression.   
In addition ,  it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ 
as a single item on t he Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g. ,   multiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes  or  multiple liver metastases ).  
      Re 
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
a. Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target lesions.  
  Complete response (CR) :   disappearance of all target lesions  
 -  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
reductio n in short axis to 
 10 mm.  
  Partial response (PR) :   at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions ,  taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
  Progressive disease (PD) :   at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of 
target les ions ,  taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir) ,  including 
baseline  
 -  In addition to the relative increase of 20% ,  the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
 -  The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered p rogression.  
  Stable disease (SD) :   neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD ,  taking as reference the smallest sum on study  
b. Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions  
Lymph Nodes.   Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination) ,  even if the nodes regress to 
 10 mm on study.  This means that 
when lymph nodes ar e included as target lesions ,  the sum of lesions may not be zero 
even if CR criteria are met since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis 
10 mm.  
Target Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.   While on study ,  all lesions 
(nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation ,  even when very small (e.g. ,  2 mm).  However ,  
sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan  that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an 
exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs ,  
it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows :   Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 129
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the  lesion has likely disappeared ,  the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  
  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure ,  a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and BML (below 
measurable limit) should be ticked.  (Note :   It is less likely that this rule will be 
used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and 
are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however ,  if a 
lymph node is believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too small to 
measure ,  a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as 
well and BML should also be ticked.)  Appendix 6 sponse Eval uation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  I nc. 130
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6      Re 
To reiterate ,  however ,  if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure ,  that should  
be recorded ,  even if it is below 5 mm ,  and ,  in that ca se ,  BML should not be ticked.  
Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non -nodal lesions fragment ,  
the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate 
the target lesion sum.  Similarly ,  as lesions coalesce ,  a pl ane between them may be 
maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer 
separable ,  the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the coalesced lesion.  
c. Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response 
for the group of non -target lesions.  Although some non -target lesions may actually be 
measurable ,  they need not be measured and ,  instead ,  should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol.  
  CR :   disappearance of all non -target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of 
tumor marker level)  
  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (
 10 mm short axis).  
  Non-CR/Non -PD :   persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or (if 
applicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
  PD :   unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
 -  The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.  
d. Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease  
When the Patient Also Has Measurable Disease.   In this setting ,  to achieve 
unequivocal progression on the basis of the non -target disease ,  there must be an overall 
level of substantial worsen ing in non -target disease in a magnitude that ,  even in the 
presence of SD or PR in target disease ,  the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or 
more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target 
disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the Patient Ha s Only Non -Measurable Disease.   This circumstance arises in 
some Phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  
The same general concepts apply here as noted above; however ,  in this instance ,  there 
is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in 
non-measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 131
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  easily quantified (by definition :   if all lesions are truly non -measurable) ,  a useful test that 
can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the  
      Re 
increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -measurable disease is 
comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for  
measurable disease; that is ,  an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter in a 
measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from  trace  to 
 large  or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread or may be 
described in protocols as  sufficient to require a change in therapy.   If unequivocal 
progression is seen ,  the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that 
point.  Although it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable 
disease ,  the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore ,  the 
increase must be substantial.  
e. New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesion s denotes disease progression; therefore ,  some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
the identification of new radiographic lesions; however ,  the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal ,  that is ,  not attributable to differences in scanning technique ,  
change in imaging modality ,  or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example ,  some  new  bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is particularly i mportant when the patient s baseline lesions show PR or 
CR.  For example ,  necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a 
 new  cystic lesion ,  which it is not.  
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at  
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  
If a new lesion is equivocal ,  for example because of its small size ,  continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion ,  then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan.  
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE  
a. Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified timepoint ,  a response assessment occurs.  
Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculatio n at each 
timepoint for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.   
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 132
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  When patients have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease only ,  Table 2 is to 
be used.

 Non -CR/non -PD  is preferred over  stable disease  for non -target 
disease since stable disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for 
assessment of efficacy in some trials; thus ,  assigning  stable disease  
when no lesions can be measured is not advised.  Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 133
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  b. Missing Assessments and Not -Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint ,  the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment ,  usually the case i s also considered not evaluable at that timepoint ,  unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) 
would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This would be most likely to happen 
in the case of PD.  For example ,  if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three 
measured lesions and ,  during the study ,  only two lesions were assessed ,  but those gave   
134/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   Appendix 6     Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
a sum of 80 mm; the patient will have achieved PD status ,  regardless of the contribution 
of the missing lesion.  
If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done 
or the scan could not be assessed because of poor image qua lity or obstructed view ,  the 
response for target lesions should be  unable to assess  since the patient is not 
evaluable.  Similarly ,  if one or more non -target lesions are not assessed ,  the response 
for non -target lesions should be  unable to assess  excep t where there is clear 
progression.  Overall response would be  unable to assess  if either the target response 
or the non -target response is  unable to assess ,   except where this is clear evidence of 
progression as this equates with the case being not eva luable at that timepoint.  
c. Best Overall Response :   All Timepoints  
The best overall response is determined once all data for the patient is known ,  and is 
interpreted as in Table 3 .  Complete or partial responses may be claimed if the criteria 
for each are  met at a subsequent time point  >=  4 weeks later.

a If a CR is truly met at the first timepoint ,  any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint ,  even 
disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline ,  qualifies as PD at that point (since disease 
must have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whe ther the minimum 
duration for SD was met.  However ,  sometimes CR may be claimed when subsequent scans 
suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR ,  not CR ,  at the 
first timepoint.  Under these circumstances ,  the original C R should be changed to PR and the 
best response is PR.  
  
d. Special Notes on Response Assessment   
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to 
 normal  size (
  10 mm) ,  they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overst ate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted 
earlier ,  this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of  zero  on the CRF.   
136/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of trea tment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
 symptomatic deterioration.   Every effort should be made to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is no t a 
descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target 
and non -target disease as shown in Tables 1
 3.

Appendix 6  
    Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. ,  very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions) ,  treatment may continue until the next 
schedu led assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment progression is confirmed ,  
the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.  
If a patient undergoes an excisional biopsy or other appropriate approach (e.g. ,  multiple 
pass es with large core needle) of a new lesion or an existing solitary progressive lesion 
that following serial sectioning and pathological examination reveals no evidence of 
malignancy (e.g. ,  inflammatory cells ,  fibrosis ,  etc.) ,  then the new lesion or solitar y 
progressive lesion will not constitute disease progression.  
In studies for which patients with advanced disease are eligible (i.e. ,  primary disease still 
or partially present) ,  the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or non -target 
lesion ,  as appropriate.  This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of CR  if the primary 
tumor is still present but not evaluated as a target or non -target lesion.

Appendix 9   
Risks Associated with Atezolizumab and Guidelines for 
Management of Adverse Events Associated with Atezolizumab   
138/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests ,  such as autoimmune 
serology or biopsies ,  should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology  ,  
when clinically indicated .  
Although most immune -related adverse events observed with atezolizumab  have been 
mild and self -limiting ,  such events  should be recognized early and treated promptly to 
avoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not have an 
immediate therapeutic effect ,  and in severe cases ,  immune -related toxicities may require 
acute management with topical  corticosteroids ,  systemic corticosteroids ,  or other 
immunosuppressive agents.   
The investigator should consider the benefit
 risk balance for a given patient prior to 
further administration of atezolizumab.  In patients who have met the criteria for 
perma nent discontinuation ,  resumption of atezolizumab may be considered if the patient 
is deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune -related event.  Patients can 
be re -challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both 
the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.   
MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES   
PULMONARY EVENTS  
Dyspnea ,  cough ,  fatigue ,  hypoxia ,  pneumonitis ,  and pulmonary infiltrates have been 
associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  Patients will be assessed for 
pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study and will also have computed 
tomography ( CT) scans of the chest performed at every tumor assessment.    
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies such as pneumonia or other infection ,  lymphangitic carcinomatosis ,  pulmonary 
embolism ,  heart failure ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,  or pulmonary 
hypertension.  Management guidelines for pulmonary events are provided in Table 1 .

ENDOCRINE EVENTS  
Thyroid disorders ,  adrenal insufficiency ,  diabetes mellitus ,  and pituitary disorders have 
been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  Management guidelines for 
endocrine events are provided in Table 4 . 
Patients with unexplained symptoms such as headache ,  fatigue ,  myalgias ,  impotence ,  
constipation ,  or mental status changes should be investigated for the presence of thyroid ,  
pituitary ,  or adrenal endocrinopathies.  Patients should be referred to an endocrinologist if 
an endocrinopathy is suspect ed.  Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) and free 
triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels should be measured to determine whether thyroid  
Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 144
/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  abnormalities are present.  Pituitary hormone levels and function tests (e.g. ,  TSH ,  growth 
hormone ,  luteinizing hormone ,  f ollicle -stimulating hormone ,  testosterone ,  prolactin ,  
adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] levels ,  and ACTH stimulation test) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (with detailed pituitary sections) may help to 
differentiate primary pituitary ins ufficiency from primary adrenal insufficiency.

IMMUNE -RELATED MYOCARDITIS  
Immune -related myocarditis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Immune -related myocarditis should be suspected in any patient presenting with signs or 
symptoms suggestive of myocarditis ,  including ,  but not limited to ,  laboratory (e.g. ,  B -type 
natriuretic peptide) or cardiac imaging abnormalities ,  dyspnea ,  chest pain ,  palpitations ,  fatigue ,  
decreased exercise tolerance ,  or syncope.  Immunerelated myocarditis  needs to be 
distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection (commonly viral ,  e.g. ,  in a patient         Appendix 9

INFUSION -RELATED REACTIONS AND CYTOKINE -RELEASE SYNDROME  
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  
However ,  patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) or cytokine -release 
syndrome (CRS) with atezolizumab may receive medication with antihistamines  ,  anti -
pyretics ,  and/ or analgesics (e.g. ,  acetaminophen).  For subsequent cycles ,  IRRs should 
be managed according to institutional guidelines.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited 
in treating atezoliz umab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing 
agranulocytosis.  
IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have been 
reported with atezolizumab.  These reactions ,  which are thought to be due to release of cytoki nes 
and/or other chemical mediators ,  occur within 24 hours of atezolizumab administration and are 
generally mild to moderate in severity.  
CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune therapy 
that results in activatio n or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune 
effector cells.  Symptoms can be progressive ,  always include fever at the onset ,  and may include 
hypotension ,  capillary leak (hypoxia) ,  and end -organ dysfunction (Lee et al. 2019).  CRS h as 
been well documented with chimeric antigen receptor T -cell therapies and bispecific T -cell 
engager antibody therapies but has also been reported with immunotherapies that target PD -1 
or PD -L1 (Rotz et al. 2017; Adashek and Feldman 2019) ,  including atezo lizumab.  
There may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS ,  and in recognition of 
the challenges in clinically distinguishing between the two ,  consolidated guidelines for medical 
management of IRRs and CRS are provided in Table 7 .

suspected in any patient presenting with signs or symptom s suggestive of meningitis or 
encephalitis ,  including ,  but not limited to ,  headache ,  neck pain ,  confusion ,  seizure ,  motor 
or sensory dysfunction ,  and altered or depressed level of consciousness.   
Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from 
potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial ,  viral ,  or fungal) or 
progression of malignancy ,  or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.   
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated 
with a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis ,  inflammation ,  
or edema.  If deemed safe by the treating physician ,  a lumbar puncture should be 
perfor med and a neurologist should be consulted.          Appendix 9

appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.  
RENAL EVENTS  
Immune -related nephritis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Eligible patients must ha ve adequate renal function . Renal function ,  including serum 
creatinine ,  should be monitored throughout atezolizumab treatment.  Patients with 
abnormal renal function should be evaluated and treated for other more common 
etiologies (including prerenal and p ostrenal causes ,  and concomitant medications such 
as non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs).  Refer the patient to a renal specialist if 
clinically indicated.  A renal biopsy may be required to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of nephritis ,  in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology ,  should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 12 . Table 12

IMMUNE -MEDIATED MYOSITIS  
Immune -mediated myositis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common 
feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomy ositis and polymyositis are among the 
most common disorders.  Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness ,  muscle 
pain ,  skin rash in dermatomyositis) ,  biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase) ,  and 
imaging (electromyography/MRI) features ,  an d is confirmed with a muscle biopsy.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis ,  in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology ,  should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 13 .

Brief Summary :   
This phase II trial studies how well Nivolumab ,  Cisplatin ,  and Pemetrexed Disodium or Gemcitabine 
Hydrochloride in treating patients with stage I -IIIA non -small cell lung cancer that can be removed by 
surgery. Monoclonal antibodies ,  such as Nivolumab ,  may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow 
and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy ,  such as Cisplatin and Pemetrexed Disodium or Gemcitabine 
Hydrochloride ,  work in di fferent ways to stop the growth of tumor cells ,  either by killing the cells ,  by 
stopping them from dividing ,  or by stopping them from spreading. Giving Nivolumab ,  Cisplatin ,  and 
Pemetrexed Disodium or Gemcitabine Hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with nonsmall cell 
lung cancer.

VI. Overall survival.  
TERTIARY OBJECTIVES :   
I. To explo re whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore 
whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN -gamma ,  IL -4 ,  IL10 ,  etc.) or cell subset 
frequencies (M2 monocytes ,  myeloid -derived suppressor cells ,  etc.) within a pat ient's peripheral 
blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment response.  
III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change 
aftercombination therapy.  
IV. To explore the predictive value of serial ce ll free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels

Brief Summary :   
A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the effi cacy of immunotherapy prior as neoadjuvant therapy. 
This study evaluates whether said neoadjuvant immunotherapy may improve improve progression free 
survival in NSCLC. One such example would be to evaluate either single agent or an immunotherapy 
combinatio n with chemotherapy. Following this ,  analysis of biomarkers will be conducted to provide 
personalization in one's regimen.
