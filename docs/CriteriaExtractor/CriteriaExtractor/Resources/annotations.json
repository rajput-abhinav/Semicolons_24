Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of two \r\n21-day cycles with atezolizumab. Following surgery ,  adjuvant therapy consisted of up to 12 months of \r\natezolizumab in participants who demonstrate clinical benefit with neoadjuvant therapy. All participants \r\nwho undergo surgery entered a surveillance period ,  which consisted of standardized blood sample \r\ncollection and Chest CT Scans ,  for up to 2 years. All parti cipants were monitored for disease recurrence \r\nand survival for up to 3 years after last dose of study drug.  \r\nCondition or \r\ndisease ! Intervention/treatment !

BACKGROUND  \r\n1.1 BACKGROUND ON NON -SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER  \r\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In the United States about \r\n200 , 000 cases are diagnosed each year with approximately 150 , 000 deaths occurring \r\nand a progressive increase in mortality with a ge (Siegel et al. 2015). Non -small cell lung \r\ncancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers and is divided into \r\nsquamous cell carcinoma ,  large cell carcinoma ,  and adenocarcinoma subtypes.  The \r\nmajority of patients present with advanced m etastatic disease that cannot be cured with \r\ncurrent therapies.  A minority of patients (about 25%) present with localized disease that \r\nis sometimes (about 50%) cured by surgical resection.  Of those not cured by surgical \r\nresection ,  the majority recur in di stant sites that could not be detected prior to surgical \r\nresection. For these Stage IB\r\n IIIA patients ,  the addition of systemic chemotherapy \r\nbefore or after surgery improved 5 -year survival rates by about 5% (Pignon et al. 2008).  \r\nChemotherapy before surger y (neoadjuvant) results in slightly higher response rates \r\ncompared to chemotherapy for advanced stages but there are essentially no complete \r\nresponses (CRs).  Recently ,  immunotherapy with antibodies that bind to checkpoint \r\ninhibitors such as programmed dea th 1 (PD -1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD -L1) \r\nhave been shown to produce long lasting responses in some patients with advanced \r\nNSCLC who were refractory to standard chemotherapy (Rizvi et al. 2015).   \r\nSubsequent randomized clinical trials showed that t hese antibodies produce superior \r\nsurvival compared to docetaxel chemotherapy in patients who progressed after systemic \r\nplatinum doublet chemotherapy (Borghaei et al. 2015; Brahmer et al. 2015;  \r\nFehrenbacher et al. 2016).  The clinical benefits were greater  in patients with high PD -L1 \r\nexpression although survival was similar to docetaxel even in patients lacking PD -L1 \r\nexpression. Early studies with these antibodies in the first line therapy setting showed  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 26\r\n/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  even better results especially in patients with high PD-L1 expression (Gettinger 2015; \r\nGaron et al. 2015). Because PD -L1 expression is a continuous variable and not a perfect \r\npredictive biomarker ,  many investigators are exploring other potential biomarkers of \r\npredictive therapeutic benefit.  The number of mu tations determined by whole -exome \r\nsequencing (WES) has been shown to perform as another potential predictive biomarker \r\n(Rizvi et al. 2015). The expression of many other genes and proteins is being explored ,  \r\nbut this is complicated by the lack of tissue and  a limited understanding of its association \r\nwith objective response rates (ORR) and survival.  \r\n1.2 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMAB  \r\nPD-L1 is an extracellular protein that downregulates immune responses primarily in \r\nperipheral tissues through binding to its two receptors PD -1 and B7.1. PD -1 is an \r\ninhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T -cell activation ,  which is sustained in  \r\nstates of chronic stimulation such as in chronic infection or cancer (Blank et al. 2005; \r\nKeir et al. 2008). Binding of PD -L1 with PD -1 inhibits T -cell proliferation ,  cytokine \r\nproduction ,  and cytolytic activity ,  leading to the functional inactivation or ex haustion of  \r\nT cells.  B7.1 is a molecule expressed on antigen -presenting cells and activated T \r\ncells.  PD -L1 binding to B7.1 on T cells and antigen -presenting cells can mediate \r\ndownregulation of immune responses ,  including inhibition of T -cell activation and \r\ncytokine production (Butte et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2011).  \r\nOverexpression of PD -L1 on tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment has been \r\nreported to impede anti -tumor immunity ,  resulting in immune evasion (Blank and \r\nMackensen 2007).  Therefore ,  interr uption of the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway represents an \r\nattractive strategy to reinvigorate tumor -specific T -cell immunity.  \r\nAtezolizumab (Tecentriq\r\n  ,  formerly MPDL3280A) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal \r\nantibody consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and tw o light chains (214 \r\namino acids) ,  and is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  Atezolizumab was \r\nengineered to eliminate Fc -effector function via a single amino acid substitution at \r\nposition 298 on the heavy chain ,  which results in a non -glycosylated an tibody that has \r\nminimal binding to Fc receptors and prevents Fc -effector function at expected \r\nconcentrations in humans.  Atezolizumab targets human PD -L1 and inhibits its \r\ninteraction with its receptors ,  PD -1 and B7.1 (CD80 ,  B7 -1).  Both of these interactio ns \r\nare reported to provide inhibitory signals to T cells.  Direct targeting of PD -L1 leaves \r\nthe PD -L2-PD-1 interaction intact ,  potentially avoiding effects on immune \r\nhomoeostasis.  \r\nAtezolizumab (Tecentriq\r\n ) is approved for the treatment urothelial carcinoma ,  non\r\n small \r\ncell lung cancer  ,  small -cell lung cancer ,  triple -negative breast cancer ,  hepatocellular carcinoma ,  \r\nand melanoma.    \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 27\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for atezolizumab for details on \r\nnonclinical and clinical studies.  \r\n1.2.1 Summary of Nonclinical Studies  \r\nThe nonclinical strategy of the atezolizumab program was to demonstrate in vitro and \r\nin vivo activity ,  to determine in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior ,  to demonstrate an \r\nacceptable safety profile ,  and to identify a Phase  I starting dose.  Comprehensive \r\npharmacology ,  PK ,  and toxicology evaluations were thus undertaken with \r\natezolizumab.  \r\nThe safety ,  pharmacokinetics ,  and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab were investigated in \r\nmice and cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous ( IV) administration and to aid in \r\nprojecting the appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the similar binding of \r\natezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and human PD -L1 ,  the cynomolgus monkey was \r\nselected as the primary and relevant nonclinical model for unde rstanding the safety ,  \r\npharmacokinetics ,  and toxicokinetics of atezolizumab.  \r\nOverall ,  the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for atezolizumab \r\nsupported entry into clinical studies ,  including providing adequate safety factors for the \r\nproposed Phase I starting doses.  The results of the toxicology program were \r\nconsistent with the anticipated pharmacologic activity of downmodulating the PD -\r\nL1/PD -1 pathway and supported entry into clinical studies in patients.  \r\nRefer to the Atezolizumab Inve stigator s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.  \r\n1.2.2  Clinical Experience with Atezolizumab  \r\nAtezolizumab clinical data are available from multiple Phase I ,  II ,  and III studies ,  both \r\nas monotherapy and in combination with several anti -cancer the rapies (see the \r\nAtezolizumab Investigator s Brochure for study descriptions).   \r\nSingle agent safety and efficacy data in patients with lung cancer are presented below \r\nfrom the following studies :   \r\n  Study PCD4989g :   A Phase Ia ,  multicenter ,  first -in-human ,  ope n label ,  dose \r\nescalation study evaluating the safety ,  tolerability ,  immunogenicity ,  \r\npharmacokinetics ,  exploratory pharmacodynamics ,  and preliminary evidence of \r\nbiologic activity of atezolizumab administered as a single agent by IV infusion \r\ngiven every 3 we eks (q3w) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid \r\nmalignancies or hematologic malignancies.  \r\n  Study GO28753 (POPLAR) :   A randomized ,  Phase II ,  open -label study assessing \r\nthe clinical benefit of atezolizumab as a single agent versus docetaxel in PD -L1-\r\nunselected patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that has \r\nprogressed during or followi ng treatment with a platinum -containing regimen.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 28\r\n/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6    Study GO28754 (BIRCH) :   A Phase II ,  multicenter ,  single -arm study assessing the \r\nclinical benefit of atezolizumab as a single agent in PD -L1-selected patients with \r\nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC  \r\n  Study G O28915 (OAK) :   A randomized ,  Phase III ,  open -label study assessing the \r\nclinical benefit of atezolizumab as a single agent versus docetaxel in PD -L1-\r\nunselected patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that has \r\nprogressed during or following treatm ent with a platinum -containing regimen.  \r\n1.2.2.1  Clinical Safety  \r\nSingle -Agent Clinical Safety in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer in \r\nStudy PCD4989g  \r\nStudy PCD4989g is a Phase Ia dose escalation and expansion study ,  in which \r\natezolizumab is being used  as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or \r\nmetastatic solid tumors or hematologic malignancies ,  and provides significant data \r\n(with 629 safety -evaluable patients across all cancer types as of the data cutoff date of \r\n15 December 2015) for the s afety profile of atezolizumab as monotherapy.  \r\nCurrently ,  no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) ,  no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) ,  and \r\nno clear dose -related trends in the incidence of adverse events have been determined.  \r\nThe safety profile of atezolizumab as a single agent is observed to be consistent \r\nacross different indications ,  including small -cell lung cancer ,  NSCLC ,  urothelial bladder \r\ncancer (UBC) ,  renal cell carcinoma (RCC) ,  melanoma ,  gastric cancer ,  colorectal \r\ncancer ,  head and neck cancer ,  breast cancer ,  and sarcoma.   \r\nOf the 629 patients across all cancer types in Study PCD4989g ,  619 patients (98.4%) \r\nexperienced at least one adverse event ,  including 444 patients (70.6%) who \r\nexperienced one treatment -related adverse event.  Commonly reported events (report ed \r\nin \r\n10% of all patients) included fatigue ,  nausea ,  decreased appetite ,  diarrhea ,  \r\nconstipation ,  dyspnea ,  pyrexia ,  and cough (see Table 1 ). \r\nA total of 89 safety -evaluable patients with NSCLC received atezolizumab in  \r\nStudy PCD4989g.  A total of 88 patient s (98.9%) experienced at least one adverse event ,  \r\nincluding 67 patients (75.3%) with treatment -related adverse events ,  35 (39.3%) patients \r\nwith Grade 3\r\n 4 adverse events ,  36 patients (40.4%) with serious adverse events ,  5 \r\npatients (5.6%) who discontinued st udy drug due to an adverse event ,  and 1 death \r\n(1.1%).  \r\nThe safety profile of the NSCLC cohort was consistent with the overall safety profile of \r\nall safety -evaluable patients in Study PCD4989g ,  as well as with the safety -evaluable \r\npatients with NSCLC who rec eived atezolizumab monotherapy in other studies.    \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 29\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Table 1  Adverse Events Reported in \r\n 10% of Patients in Study PCD4989g  \r\nPreferred Term  All Grades \r\nn (%)  \r\nAny adverse event (\r\n 10% incidence)  592 (94.1%)  \r\nFatigue  248 (39.4%)  \r\nNausea  175 (27.8%)  \r\nDecreased appetite  166 (26.4%)  \r\nDiarrhea  141 (22.4%)  \r\nConstipation  136 (21.6%)  \r\nDyspnea  135 (21.5%)  \r\nPyrexia  134 (21.3%)  \r\nCough  127 (20.2%)  \r\nVomiting  124 (19.7%)  \r\nAnemia  121 (19.2%)  \r\nBack Pain  111 (17.6%)  \r\nHeadache  104 (16.5%)  \r\nAsthenia  101 (16.1%)  \r\nArthralgia  95 (15.1%)  \r\nPruritus  89 (14.1%)  \r\nRash  82 (13.0%)  \r\nAbdominal pain  77 (12.2%)  \r\nEdema peripheral  72 (11.4%)  \r\nUrinary tract infection  67 (10.7%)  \r\nInsomnia  66 (10.5%)  \r\nDizziness  63 (10.0%)   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 30\r\n/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  Single -Agent Clinical Safety in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer in \r\nStudy GO28753 (POPLAR)  \r\nAs of the 1 December 2015 data cutoff date ,  142 patients with NSCLC were treated with \r\natezolizumab as a fixed dose of 1200 mg IV q3w and 135 patients were treated with \r\ndocetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV q3w in Study GO28753.  The frequency of patients with any \r\nreported  adverse event regardless of attribution was 96% in both arms.  Fewer patients \r\nin the atezolizumab arm (41%) experienced Grade 3\r\n 4 adverse events compared with \r\nthe docetaxel arm (53%).  For Grade 3\r\n 4 adverse events that were assessed as \r\ntreatment -related ,  the difference was greater between the two arms (12% vs. 39% ,  \r\nrespectively).  The most common atezolizumab -related Grade 3 advers e events were \r\npneumonia (2%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (2%).  No atezolizumab -\r\nrelated Grade 4 events have been reported.

The most commonly reported  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 32\r\n/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  immune -mediated events with atezolizumab are dermatologic reactions and laboratory \r\nabnormali ties (changes in liver function tests and thyroid function tests). Given the \r\nprotocol design ,  short timeframe from atezolizumab administration to surgery ,  and the \r\nknown longer time to onset of such events ,  these events are considered unlikely in the \r\nNeoadj uvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase of this study (see Section 1.3). \r\n1.2.2.2  Clinical Activity  \r\nAnti-tumor activity ,  including Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 \r\n(RECIST v1.1) -based responses ,  have been observed in patients with different  tumor \r\ntypes (including NSCLC ,  RCC ,  melanoma ,  gastric cancer ,  UBC ,  colorectal cancer ,  \r\nhead and neck cancer ,  breast cancer ,  and sarcoma) treated with atezolizumab in Study \r\nPCD4989g.  \r\nRefer to the Atezolizumab Investigator s Brochure for details on clinical a ctivity in all \r\npatients treated to date ,  regardless of tumor type.  \r\nSingle -agent data from Studies PCD4989g and GO28754 (BIRCH) ,  and data from the \r\nrandomized Study GO28753 (POPLAR) in patients with advanced NSCLC are \r\nsummarized below.  \r\nSingle -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer \r\nin Study PCD4989g  \r\nAs of the 02 December 2014 cutoff date ,  88 patients with NSCLC in Study PCD4989g \r\nwho received their first dose of atezolizumab by 21 October 2013 were evaluable for \r\nefficacy.  The media n age was 60.5 years; the group represented a heavily pre -treated \r\npatient population.  RECIST responses (confirmed) were observed in 20 of 88 (22.7%) \r\npatients ,  inclusive of squamous and non -squamous histologies and across all \r\ntreatment cohorts (treatment d ose levels :  1 to 20 mg/kg).  A total of 8 of the 20 \r\nresponding patients have continued to respond at the time of the clinical data cutoff.  \r\nSingle -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer \r\nin Study GO28753 (POPLAR)  \r\nIn Study GO28753  (POPLAR) ,  demographic characteristics were comparable between \r\nthe atezolizumab and docetaxel treatment arms in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population.  \r\nThe median age was 62 years in both treatment arms ,  and the majority of patients had \r\none prior therapy (6 5% for atezolizumab and 67% for docetaxel) ,  non -squamous \r\nhistology (66% for atezolizumab and 66% for docetaxel) ,  and Eastern Cooperative \r\nOncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 (68% for atezolizumab and 68% for \r\ndocetaxel).  More females were enrolled  in the docetaxel arm (35% vs. 47%).  \r\nAt the primary analysis on 8 May 2015 ,  there were 287 efficacy -evaluable patients (ITT \r\npopulation) ,  143 in the docetaxel arm and 144 in the atezolizumab arm. Median OS was \r\n12.6 months for atezolizumab compared with 9.7 months for docetaxel (HR of 0.73; 95%  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 33\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  CI :   0.53 ,  0.99).  Increasing improvement in OS was associated with increasing PD -L1 \r\nexpression.  Survival was similar to docetaxel in patients lacking PD -L1 expression and \r\nimproved with atezolizumab in both responders  and non -responders.  Progression -free \r\nsurvival (PFS) and ORR were similar between the two treatment arms in the ITT \r\npopulation (Fehrenbacher et al. 2016).  \r\nSingle -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer \r\nin Study GO28754 (BIRCH)  \r\nIn the BIRCH study ,  659 PD -L1-selected patients with advanced NSCLC were \r\ntreated with atezolizumab; 139 patients were naive to prior chemotherapy (Cohort 1)  \r\nand 520 patients had received at least one prior platinum -based chemotherapy \r\nregimen (Cohorts 2 and 3).  ORR was 19% in Cohort 1 and 17% in the other two \r\ncohorts.  The majority of responses were ongoing and duration of response and OS \r\ndata were not mature  (Besse et al. 2015).  \r\nSingle -Agent Clinical Activity in Patients with Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer \r\nin Study GO28915 (OAK)  \r\nIn the OAK study ,  demographic characteristics were comparable between the \r\natezolizumab and docetaxel treatment arms in the ITT populati on.  The majority of \r\npatients had one prior therapy (75% in both arms) ,  non -squamous histology (74% in \r\nboth arms) ,  history of tobacco use (80% for atezolizumab and 83% for docetaxel) ,  and \r\nECOG Performance Status of 1 (64% for atezolizumab and 62% for docet axel).   \r\nAt the primary analysis ,  there were 850 efficacy -evaluable patients (ITT \r\npopulation) :   425 in the docetaxel arm and 425 in the atezolizumab arm. Median \r\nOS in the ITT population was 13.8 months for atezolizumab compared with 9.6 \r\nmonths for docetaxe l (HR of 0.73; 95% CI :  0.62 ,  0.87 ,  p\r\n 0.0003).  OS benefit was \r\nseen regardless of PD -L1 expression (HR of 0.75 in\r\n 1% PD -L1 expression \r\npopulation;  \r\n0.41 in \r\n 50% tumor cell or \r\n 10% immune cell expression population) and was \r\nconsistent across subgroups ,  includ ing histology (HR of 0.73 for both) ,  in patients with \r\nasymptomatic central nervous system metastases (HR of 0.54) and never smokers \r\n(HR of 0.71). PFS and ORR were similar between the two treatment arms in the ITT \r\npopulation (Rittmeyer et al. 2017).  \r\n1.2.2.3  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  \r\nOn the basis of available preliminary PK data (0.03\r\n 20 mg/kg) ,  atezolizumab appeared \r\nto show linear pharmacokinetics at doses \r\n 1 mg/kg.  For the 1 -mg/kg and 20 -mg/kg dose \r\ngroups ,  the mean apparent clearance and  the mean volume of distribution under steady -\r\nstate conditions had a range of 3.20 to 4.44 mL/kg and 48.1 to 65.7 mL/kg ,  respectively ,  \r\nwhich is consistent with the expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in humans.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 34\r\n/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  Development of anti -therapeutic antibodies ( ATAs) has been observed in patients in all \r\ncohorts in Study PCD4989g and was associated with changes in PK (namely ,  a \r\nreduction of atezolizumab C min to below the PK assay lower limit of quantification) ,  in \r\nsome patients in the lower dose cohorts (0.3 ,  1 ,  a nd 3 mg/kg).  The development of \r\ndetectable ATAs has not had a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from \r\n10 to 20 mg/kg.  Patients dosed at the 10 - ,  15- ,  and 20 -mg/kg dose levels have \r\nmaintained the expected target trough levels of drug despite  the detection of ATAs.  To \r\ndate ,  no clear relationship between the detection of ATAs and adverse events ,  infusion \r\nreactions ,  or efficacy has been observed.  \r\n1.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT  \r\nIt is hypothesized that administration of atezolizu mab ,  an engineered IgG1 monoclonal \r\nantibody targeting PD -L1 ,  will demonstrate a good safety profile and produce objective \r\nresponses in clinical Stage IB -IIIA NSCLC ,  especially in tumors which express PD -L1 \r\nprior to resection. PD -L1 expression by tumor and immune cells results in impaired \r\nanti-tumor immune responses by inhibiting T -cell proliferation ,  cytokine production ,  and \r\ncytotoxic activity. As a result there is significant interest in developing therapeutics to \r\nblock the immunosuppressive effects of PD -L1 and to identify patients who will benefit \r\nfrom this treatment strategy.  \r\nWhile the addition of adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy following surgical resection \r\nof early stage NSCLC has produced significant survival benefits (Pignon et al. 2008) ,  \r\nrates  of local and distant disease relapse leading to death remain unacceptably high. \r\nStudies show that neoadjuvant chemotherapy has approximately the same benefit as \r\nadjuvant (Felip et al. 2010).  Thus ,  it is critical to investigate the use of atezolizumab and  \r\nsimilar agents in treating early stage resectable disease where one can assess the \r\nimmune environment before and after treatment. It is also critical to develop highly \r\npredictive biomarkers of benefit and to study the evolution of immune -related markers \r\nwith treatment with atezolizumab.   \r\nThere will be two parts to this study :   the first part (Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy \r\nPhase) will evaluate the ability of atezolizumab ,  an engineered IgG1 monoclonal \r\nantibody targeting PD -L1 ,  to produce pathologic resp onses in the neoadjuvant setting \r\nin patients with early stage NSCLC who have a pretreatment biopsy.   \r\nThe subsequent resection of tumors from these patients will allow determination of \r\npathologic response rates and potential predictive biomarkers from the pretreatment \r\nbiopsy and evolution of cancer -/immune - related markers associated with response in \r\nthe tumor biopsy specimen after treatment.   \r\nThe primary endpoint of the study will be major pathologic response rate (defined as \r\n  \r\n10% of viable tumor cells) determined from the surgical resection (Hellmann et al. \r\n2014).  In addition ,  response rates according to RECIST v1.1 will be determined from  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 35\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  chest CT scans obtained before and after the atezolizumab therapy and before surgical \r\nresection.   \r\nThe Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase will only include patients with Stage IB ,  \r\nII ,  IIIA ,  or selected IIIB disease and who are deemed suitable for surgi cal resection \r\nwithout metastatic disease but with sufficient material for initial biopsy to analyze \r\nbiomarkers.  Clinical staging of NSCLC is based on computed tomography (CT) of the \r\nchest and upper abdomen ,  positron emission tomography (PET) and brain CT or \r\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out metastatic disease and assess the \r\npotential for curative -intent resection.  Resection represents the best chance for \r\nprolonged survival for patients with non -advanced NSCLC.  \r\n \r\n \r\nThere are little data to guide the duration of adjuvant immunotherapy in lung cancer.  An \r\nongoing Phase III study is evaluating 12 months of atezolizumab treatment after \r\ncisplatin -based chemotherapy in patients with completely resected Stage IB  - IIIA NSCLC \r\nwith high PD -L1 expression.  Another Phase III study is currently recruiting patients with \r\nunresectable Stage III NSCLC to receive 1 year of consolidation anti -PD-1 therapy after \r\ndefinitive chemo -radiation.  Adjuvant immunotherapy has also been explored in  other \r\nsolid tumors.  Adjuvant immunotherapy treatment for 1 year with interferon alfa -2b \r\nprolongs the relapse -free interval and OS of high -risk resected melanoma patients \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 36\r\n/Protocol ML392 36 ,  Version 6  (Kirkwood et al. 1996).

OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  \r\nThis study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab in patients with \r\nNSCLC.  Specific objectives and corresponding endpoints for the study are outlined in \r\nTable 3 . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\nNeoadjuvant treatment (Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase) with atezolizumab \r\n1200 mg q21d (one cycle\r\n 21 days) will be given for a maximum of 2 cycles ,  and \r\nadjuvant treatment (Adjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase) with atezolizumab 1200 mg \r\nq21d will be g iven for maximum of 12 months.  \r\n \r\nPatients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study.  Safety \r\nassessments will include collection and monitoring of adverse events and laboratory \r\nabnormalities graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Crite ria \r\nfor Adverse Events ,  Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).  Laboratory safety assessments will \r\ninclude the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry.     \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc.  \r\n35/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  \r\nA schedule of activities is provided in Appendix 1 .   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n Atezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc.  \r\n36/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n38/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc.   \r\n 3.1.2  Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase  \r\nDuring this phase of the study ,  patients will have their NSCLC assessed by CT scan of \r\nthe chest (with IV contrast) ,  PET/CT ,  and brain MRI (preferably with gadolinium).  \r\n  Brain \r\nimaging may be omitted for patients with clinical Stage IB tumors but should be obtained \r\nfor patients with clinical Stages II ,  IIIA ,  and selected IIIB tumors.  If brain MRI is not \r\nfeasible for technical or patient -related reasons (e.g. ,  pacemaker ,  severe claustrophobia) ,  \r\nbrain CT scan with IV contrast should be obtained. Tumor biop sy ,  whole blood samples ,  \r\n \r\nwill be obtained before  \r\nPatients will receive two doses of atezolizumab administered 3 weeks apart before \r\nsurgical resection.  Patients who have radiologic progression prior to the second dose \r\nwill be discontinued from atezolizumab and the patient will not have surgical resection  as \r\npart of this study.  \r\nSurgical Resection  \r\nFollowing induction therapy in the Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase ,  patients \r\nwill undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor and associated lymph nodes.  \r\nRepeat chest CT scan ,  PET/CT scan ,  and MRI of th e brain will be obtained prior to \r\nsurgical resection and collected for review.  \r\ntreatment with atezolizumab.  Either archival or newly collected sections of tumor biopsy  \r\nwill be formalin -fixed and fresh frozen (see Section  \r\n4.1.1  \r\n) \r\n.  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n39/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 48\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\n3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  \r\n3.3.1  Rationale for Atezolizumab Dose and Schedule  \r\nThe fixed dose of 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight -based dose of  \r\n15 mg/kg) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies described in  \r\nSection 1.2.1 and available clinical data from Study PCD4989g as described below.  \r\nThe target exposure for atezolizumab was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue \r\ndistribution  data in tumor -bearing mice ,  target -receptor occupancy in the tumor ,  the \r\nobserved atezolizumab interim pharmacokinetics in humans ,  and other factors. The \r\ntarget trough concentration (C trough) was projected to be 6 \r\n g/mL on the basis of several \r\nassumptions ,   including the following :   1) 95% tumor -receptor saturation is needed for \r\nefficacy and 2) the tumor -interstitial concentration to plasma ratio is 0.30 based on tissue \r\ndistribution data in tumor -bearing mice.  \r\nThe atezolizumab dose is also informed by availa ble clinical activity ,  safety ,  \r\npharmacokinetics ,  and immunogenicity data. Anti -tumor activity has been observed \r\nacross doses from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg q21d.  The MTD of atezolizumab was not \r\nreached ,  and no DLTs have been observed at any dose in Study PCD498 9g. Currently \r\navailable PK and ATA data suggest that the 15 -mg/kg atezolizumab q3w regimen (or \r\nfixed -dose equivalent) for Phase II and Phase III studies would be sufficient to both \r\nmaintain C trough \r\n 6 \r\ng/mL and further safeguard against both interpatient v ariability and \r\nthe potential effect of ATAs that could lead to subtherapeutic levels of atezolizumab \r\nrelative to the 10 -mg/kg atezolizumab q3w regimen (or fixed -dose equivalent).  From \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 49\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  inspection of available observed C trough data ,  moving further to the 20 -mg/kg \r\natezolizumab q3w regimen does not appear to be warranted to maintain targeted C trough \r\nlevels relative to the proposed 15 -mg/kg atezolizumab q3w level.  \r\nSimulations (Bai et al. 2012) do not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in \r\nexposure fo llowing a fixed dose or a dose adjusted for weight.  Therefore ,  a fixed dose \r\nof 1200 mg has been selected (equivalent to an average body weight\r\n based dose of \r\n15 mg/kg).  Selection of an every -21-day dosing interval is supported by this \r\npreliminary PK evalu ation.  \r\nRefer to the Atezolizumab Investigator s Brochure for details regarding nonclinical and \r\nclinical pharmacology of atezolizumab.  \r\n3.3.2  Rationale for Patient Population  \r\nWhile the addition of adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy following surgical resection \r\nof early stage NSCLC has produced significant survival benefits (Pignon et al. 2008) ,  \r\nrates of local and distant disease relapse leading to death remain unacceptably high.  \r\nStudies show that neoadjuvant chemotherapy has approximately the same benefit as \r\nadjuvant (Felip et al. 2010).  Recently ,  immunotherapy with antibodies that bind to \r\ncheckpoint inhibitors such as PD -1 and PD -L1 have been shown to produce long lasting \r\nresponses in some patients with advanced NSCLC who were refractory to standard \r\nchemotherap y (Brahmer et al. 2015).  Therefore this study population was chosen to \r\nprimarily determine the ability of atezolizumab to produce objective responses in \r\npatients  \r\nundergoing curative intent surgery for Stage IB -IIIA NSCLC.    \r\n  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 50\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 51\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\nSee Section 2 for details for secondary and exploratory laboratory analyses.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 52\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  4.

The investigator will \r\nmaintain a screening log t o record details of all patients screened and to confirm \r\neligibility or record reasons for screening failure ,  as applicable.  \r\nThe following ICFs will be available :   \r\nAn optional prescreening ICF may be requested for patients undergoing SOC biopsy if \r\nthe patie nt does not have adequate available archival tumor tissue as required by the  \r\n \r\n4.5.2  Prescreening Tumor Biopsy  \r\nA prescreening tumor biopsy could be conducted for patients who do not have an \r\nadequate tumor specimen ,  in the opinion of the investigator.  This prescreening biopsy \r\nwill be used to diagnose the patient and for tissue analysis.  This biopsy will not need t o \r\nbe repeated at study screening if the sample taken is adequate ,  as specified in the \r\ninclusion criteria (see Section 4.1.1 ).  \r\nIf a patient has an adequate archival tumor biopsy to yield required FFPE and \r\nfreshfrozen samples ,  no prescreening biopsy will be needed.   \r\n4.5.3  Medical History and Demographic Data  \r\nMedical history includes clinically significant diseases ,  surgeries ,  canc er history \r\n(including histology ,  grade ,  stage ,  prior cancer therapies and procedures) ,  smoking \r\nhistory ,  asbestos ,  pleural or pericardial effusion ,  ascites requiring intervention ,  exposure ,  \r\nHPV infection and HPV subtypes ,  associated syndromes ,  Helicobacter pylori infection ,  \r\nrelevant mutations ,  and reproductive status (women).  In addition ,  all medications (e.g. ,  \r\nprescription drugs ,  over -the-counter drugs ,  vaccines ,  herbal or homeopathic remedies ,  \r\nnutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days pri or to screening will be \r\nrecorded.  \r\nprotocol.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 64\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Demographic data will include age ,  sex ,  and self -reported race/ethnicity.  \r\n4.5.4  Physical Examinations  \r\nA complete physical examination should be performed at screening and at the \r\npresurgery visit. The examination should inc lude an evaluation of the head ,  eyes ,  ears ,  \r\nnose ,  and throat ,  and the cardiovascular ,  dermatological ,  musculoskeletal ,  respiratory ,  \r\ngastrointestinal ,  and neurological systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should \r\nbe recorded on the General Medica l History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  \r\n \r\nVital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate ,  pulse rate ,  and systolic and \r\ndiastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position ,  and temperature.  \r\nIn the Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase ,  the patient s vital signs should be \r\nmeasured within 60 minutes before the infusion ,  and during the infusion and after the \r\ninfusion ,  if clinically indicated.   \r\nBlood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be measured in the Neoadjuvant \r\nAtezolizumab Therapy Phase as specified in Appendix 1 . \r\n  \r\n4.5.6  Tumor and Response Evaluations  \r\nNeoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase  \r\nDuring the Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase ,  the patient s tumor will be staged \r\nat screening by contrast -enhanced (if patient is not contrast -allergic) helical CT scan of \r\nthe chest ,  PET\r\n CT ,  and brain MRI ,  preferably with gadolinium (for Stage II or IIIA \r\ndisease).  If brain MRI is not feasible for technical or patient -related reasons (e.g. ,  \r\npacemaker ,  severe claustrophobia) ,  brain CT scan with IV contrast should be obtained.   \r\nAll scans will be repeated prior to surgery to confirm surgical eligibility.   \r\nAt the investigator s discretion ,  scans may be repeated at any time if progressive \r\ndisease is suspected.  \r\nRadiographic responses will be assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 after two \r\ncycles of neoadjuvant atezolizumab.  \r\nPathologic responses will be assessed from surgically resected tumor by the site \r\npathologist.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n4.5.5  \r\n Vital Signs   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 65\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  All radiologic digital imaging (includi ng CT and CT/PET scans plus all supporting \r\nradiologic interpretation or reports) will be submitted for central review.

Patients who withdraw from the study \r\nwill not be replaced.  \r\nIf a patient withdraws from the study ,  the study staff may use a public information source \r\n(e.g. ,  county records) to obtain information about survival status.  \r\n4.6.2  Atezolizumab Treatment Discont inuation  \r\nPatients must discontinue neoadjuvant or adjuvant atezolizumab treatment if they \r\nexperience any of the following :   \r\n  Pregnancy  \r\n  Radiographic disease progression and/or symptomatic deterioration attributed to \r\ndisease progression as determined by the in vestigator after integrated assessment \r\nof radiographic data ,  biopsy results ,  and clinical status.  Please note all radiographic \r\nimages related to disease will be collected.  \r\n  Intolerable toxicity related to atezolizumab ,  including development of an irAE \r\ndetermined by the investigator to be unacceptable given the individual patient s \r\npotential response to therapy and severity of the event.  May contact Medical \r\nMonitor and Sponso r for further guidance.  \r\n  Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize \r\nthe patient s safety if he or she continues on atezolizumab  \r\n  Use of another non -protocol -specified anti -cancer therapy  \r\nThe primary reason for atezolizum ab discontinuation should be documented on the \r\nappropriate eCRF.  \r\nIf patient prematurely discontinues neo -adjuvant treatment for any reason other than \r\nprogressive disease (after Cycle 1 and before surgery) ,  they may proceed with surgery \r\nas part of the study  and enter surveillance. If patient discontinues treatment for any \r\nreason after surgery ,  they should remain in Surveillance until they complete 2 years and  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 72\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  then move to Survival Follow -up.  Patients who discontinue atezolizumab prematurely \r\nwill not be repl aced.  \r\n4.6.3  Study and Site Discontinuation  \r\nThe Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating \r\nthe study may include ,  but are not limited to ,  the following :   \r\n  The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other st udies indicates a \r\npotential health hazard to patients.  \r\n  Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory.  \r\nThe Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study.   \r\nThe Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time.  Reasons for closing a site may \r\ninclude ,  but are not limited to ,  the following :   \r\n  Excessively slow recruitment  \r\n  Poor protocol adherence  \r\n  Inaccurate or incomplete data recording  \r\n  Non-compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline \r\nfor Good Clinical Practice  \r\n  No study activity (i.e. ,  all patients have completed the study and all obligations have \r\nbeen fulfilled)  \r\n5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  \r\n5.1 SAFETY PLAN  \r\nAtezolizumab is approved in the United States for the treatment of locally advanced or \r\nmetastatic UC.  The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience \r\nwith atezolizumab in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated important sa fety \r\nrisks for atezolizumab are outlined below.   \r\nMeasures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study ,  \r\nincluding the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of \r\npatients during the study.  Admin istration of atezolizumab will be performed in a \r\nmonitored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate \r\nequipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions.  Guidelines for \r\nmanaging anticipated adverse events ,  inc luding criteria for dosage modification and \r\ntreatment interruption or discontinuation ,  are provided below.  In addition ,  a pre -specified \r\ninterim safety analysis will be conducted to evaluate the safety data during the study.  \r\n5.1.1  Risks Associated with At ezolizumab  \r\nAtezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following :   infusion -related \r\nreactions and immune -related hepatitis ,  pneumonitis ,  colitis ,  pancreatitis ,  diabetes  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 73\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  mellitus ,  hypothyroidism ,  hyperthyroidism ,  adrenal insufficiency ,  hypophysi tis ,  Guillain -\r\nBarre syndrome ,  myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis ,  meningoencephalitis ,  \r\nmyocarditis ,  nephritis  ,  myositis ,  and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Immune -mediated \r\nreactions may involve any organ system and may lead to hemophagocytic lym phohistiocytosis \r\n(HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) ,  which are considered to be potential risks \r\nfor atezolizumab .   \r\nRefer to Appendix 9 of the protocol and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's \r\nBrochure for a detailed description of anti cipated safety risks for atezolizumab.  \r\nSystemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by an excessive immune \r\nresponse.  Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab ,  systemic immune activation \r\nis considered a potential risk when given in com bination with other immunomodulating \r\nagents.  Systemic immune activation should be included in the differential diagnosis for \r\npatients who ,  in the absence of an alternative etiology ,  develop a sepsis -like syndrome \r\nafter administration of atezolizumab ,  and the initial evaluation should include the \r\nfollowing :   \r\n  CBC with peripheral smear  \r\n  PT ,  PTT ,  fibrinogen ,  and D -dimer  \r\n  Ferritin  \r\n  Triglycerides  \r\n  AST ,  ALT ,  and total bilirubin  \r\n  LDH \r\n  Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly)  \r\nIf systemic immune activation is still suspected after the initial evaluation ,  contact the \r\nMedical Monitor for additional recommendations.  \r\n5.1.2  Management of Patients Who Experi ence Specific Adverse  \r\nEvents   \r\nGuidelines for management of patients who experience specific adverse events \r\nassociated with atezolizumab ,  including infusion -related reactions and immune -related \r\nevents (e.g. ,  myocarditis and pulmonary ,  hepatic ,  gastrointesti nal ,  endocrine ,  ocular ,  \r\npancreatic ,  dermatologic ,  neurologic ,  and renal events) ,  are provided in the Appendix 9 . \r\n5.1.2.1  Atezolizumab Dose Modification and Treatment Interruption  \r\nAtezolizumab dose modification is not allowed in the Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab  \r\nTherapy Phase.  The following rules apply :  1 ) if atezolizumab is interrupted during \r\ninfusion due to reaction ,  but resumed ,  patient may proceed with all future study -related \r\nactivities ,  2) if atezolizumab is held (e.g. ,  treatment is delayed) after first d ose due to \r\ntolerability concerns ,  the Investigator may choose to discontinue patient from study if \r\nmedically indicated ,  3) if the patient receives less than prescribed dose of atezolizumab  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 74\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  (e.g. if infusion cannot be completed) ,  patient continuation in the  study will require \r\nMedical Monitor approval. If the patient does not discontinue from study ,  they may \r\nproceed as per protocol.  Investigator may contact Medical Monitor for further guidance.  \r\nIf the patient discontinues treatment ,  they will enter Survival  Follow -up ,  as specified in \r\nSection 4.6.  \r\nAtezolizumab dose modification is not allowed during Adjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy \r\nPhase.  However ,  atezolizumab may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing \r\ntoxicity considered to be related to atezolizum ab for up to 12 weeks after the last dose if \r\nthey experience toxicity that require a dose to be withheld.  If atezolizumab is withheld \r\nbecause of toxicity for \r\n 12 weeks after the last dose ,  then the patient will be \r\ndiscontinued from atezolizumab treatment and will be followed for safety and efficacy as \r\nspecified in Section 4.6. If a patient must be tapered off corticosteroids used to treat \r\nadverse events ,  atezolizumab may be held for \r\n 12 weeks after the last dose until \r\ncorticosteroids are discontinued or re duced to prednisone dose of \r\n 10 mg/day (or \r\nequivalent).  \r\nDose interruptions for reasons other than toxicity (e.g. ,  surgical procedures) may be \r\nallowed ,  with Medical Monitor approval.  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will \r\ndetermine the acceptable le ngth of interruption.  \r\nGuidelines for management of specific adverse events associated with atezolizumab are \r\nprovided in the Appendix 9 . \r\n5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS  \r\nSafety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events ,  including \r\nserious adverse events and adverse events of special interest ,  performing protocol -\r\nspecified safety laboratory assessments ,  measuring protocol -specified vital signs ,  and \r\nconducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation \r\nof the study.  \r\nCertain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor ,  as outlined in \r\nSection 5.4. \r\n5.2.1  Adverse Events  \r\nAccording to the ICH guideline fo r Good Clinical Practice ,  an adverse event is any \r\nuntoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a \r\npharmaceutical product ,  regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can \r\ntherefore be any of the following :   \r\n  Any unfavora ble and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) ,  \r\nsymptom ,  or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product ,  \r\nwhether or not considered related to the medicinal product   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 75\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing dis ease (a worsening in the \r\ncharacter ,  frequency ,  or severity of a known condition) ,  except as described in \r\nSection 5.3.5.10  \r\n  Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g. ,  headache) not present at \r\nbaseline  \r\n  Any deterioration in a laboratory value or ot her clinical test (e.g. ,  ECG ,  X -ray) that is \r\nassociated with symptoms or leads to a change in atezolizumab treatment or \r\nconcomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug  \r\n  Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention ,  including those \r\nthat occur prior to assignment of atezolizumab treatment (e.g. ,  screening invasive \r\nprocedures such as biopsies)  \r\n5.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the  Sponsor)  \r\nA serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria :   \r\n  Is fatal (i.e. ,  the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)  \r\n  Is life threatening (i.e. ,  the adverse event ,  in the view of the investigator ,  places the \r\npatient at  immediate risk of death)  \r\n -  This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or \r\nwas allowed to continue might have caused death.  \r\n  Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.11 ) \r\n  Results in persistent o r significant disability/incapacity (i.e. ,  the adverse event \r\nresults in substantial disruption of the patient s ability to conduct normal life \r\nfunctions)  \r\n  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to \r\nstudy drug  \r\n  Is a s ignificant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g. ,  may jeopardize the \r\npatient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes \r\nlisted above)  \r\nThe terms \"severe\" and \"serious\" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the  intensity of \r\nan adverse event (e.g. ,  rated as mild ,  moderate ,  or severe ,  or according to National \r\nCancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]; see \r\nSection 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical signific ance (such as \r\nsevere headache without any further findings).  \r\nSeverity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event \r\nrecorded on the eCRF.  \r\nSerious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor \r\nimmed iately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for \r\nreporting instructions).   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 76\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  5.2.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to  \r\nthe Sponsor)  \r\nSee Appendix 10 for list of adverse events of special interest.  \r\n5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FOR CAPTURING AND ASSESSING SAFETY \r\nPARAMETERS  \r\nThe investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for \r\ndefinition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in \r\naccordance with instructions provided in this section and in ,  Sections 5.4 ,  5.5 ,  and 5.6. \r\nFor each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  the investigator will make \r\nan assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria) ,  severity (see \r\nSection 5.3.3 ) ,  and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). \r\n5.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  \r\nInvestigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All \r\nadverse events ,  (including the neoadjuvant phase ,  surgery phase ,  and adjuvant phase) \r\nwhether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel ,  will be recorded in  the \r\npatient s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.   \r\nAfter informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug  ,  \r\nonly serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g. ,  invasive \r\nprocedures such as biopsie s ,  discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see \r\nSection 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).  \r\nAfter initiation of study drug  ,  all adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the \r\nlast dose of atezolizumab (neoadjuv ant or adjuvant ,  whichever occurs last).  Serious \r\nadverse events and non -serious adverse events of special interest will be reported until \r\n90 days after the last dose of atezolizumab (neoadjuvant or adjuvant ,  whichever occurs \r\nlast). For patients participat ing in the Adjuvant Atezolizumab Therapy Phase ,  as outlined \r\nin Section 3.1.4  ,  who will receive and complete SOC chemotherapy prior to adjuvant \r\natezolizumab ,  all AE s will be reported from their first dose of neoadjuvant atezolizumab \r\nuntil 30 days after the  last dose of adjuvant atezolizumab. Additionally ,  serious adverse \r\nevents and non -serious adverse events of special interest will be reported until 90 days \r\nafter the last dose of adjuvant atezolizumab for these patients.  \r\n \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 77\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\nInstructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting \r\nperiod are provided in Section 5.6. \r\n5.3.2  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  \r\nA consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting \r\nadver se event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of non -directive \r\nquestions include the following :   \r\n\"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?\"  \r\n\"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?\"  \r\n5.3.3  Asses sment of Severity of Adverse Events  \r\nThe adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for \r\nassessing adverse event severity. Table 6 will be used for assessing severity for \r\nadverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 78\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Table 6  Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically \r\nListed in NCI CTCAE  \r\nGrade  Severity  \r\n1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; \r\nor intervention not indicated  \r\n2 Moderate; minimal ,  local ,  or non -invasive intervention indicated; or limiting \r\nage-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a \r\n3 Severe or medically significant ,  but not immediately life -threatening; \r\nhospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or \r\nlimiting self -care activities of daily living b ,  c \r\n4 Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated d \r\n5 Death related to adverse event d \r\nNCI CTCAE\r\n National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  \r\nNote :   Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v4.0) ,  which can be found at :    \r\n a \r\nInstrumental activi ties of daily living refer to preparing meals ,  shopping for groceries or \r\nclothes ,  using the telephone ,  managing money ,  etc.  \r\nb Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing ,  dressing and undressing ,  \r\nfeeding oneself ,  using the toilet ,  and ta king medications ,  as performed by patients who are \r\nnot bedridden.  \r\nc If an event is assessed as a \"significant medical event , \" it must be reported as a serious \r\nadverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions) ,  per the definition of serious \r\nadverse  event in Section 5.2.2 . \r\nd Grade 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting \r\ninstructions) ,  per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 . \r\n5.3.4  Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  \r\nInvestigators s hould use their knowledge of the patient ,  the circumstances surrounding \r\nthe event ,  and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an \r\nadverse event is considered to be related to the study drug ,  indicating \"yes\" or \"no\" \r\naccording ly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table \r\n7) :  \r\n  Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug  \r\n  Course of the event ,  with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction ,  \r\ndiscontinuation of study drug ,  or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)  \r\n  Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments  \r\n  Known association  of the event with the disease under study  \r\n  Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to \r\nincrease the occurrence of the event  \r\n  Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the \r\noccurrence  of the event   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 79\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Table 7  Causal Attribution Guidance  \r\nIs the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts ,  evidence ,  \r\nscience -based rationales ,  and clinical judgment?  \r\nYES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and \r\nadministration of the study drug ,  and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by \r\nthe patient's clinical state ,  intercurrent illness ,  or concomitant therapies; a nd/or the \r\nadverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the \r\nadverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose \r\nreduction and ,  if applicable ,  reappears upon re -challenge.  \r\nNO An adverse event will be  considered related ,  unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .   \r\nEvidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug \r\n(e.g. ,  preexisting medical condition ,  underlying disease ,  intercurrent illness ,  or \r\nconcomitant medicati on); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal \r\nrelationship to administration of the study drug (e.g. ,  cancer diagnosed 2 days after \r\nfirst dose of study drug).  \r\nFor patients receiving combination therapy ,  causality will be assessed individually for \r\neach protocol -mandated therapy.  \r\n5.3.5  Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  \r\nInvestigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse \r\nevent s on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  \r\nOnly one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event \r\neCRF.  \r\n5.3.5.1  Infusion -Related Reactions  \r\nAdverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after treatment administration and are \r\njudged to be related to study treatment infusion (atezolizumab or docetaxel) should be captured \r\nas a diagnosis (e.g. ,  \"infusion -related reaction\") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible ,  avoid \r\nambiguous terms such as \"syst emic reaction.\"   \r\nAssociated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction \r\neCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study \r\ntreatment ,  each reaction should be recorded separatel y on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  with signs \r\nand symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF.  \r\n5.3.5.2  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  \r\nFor adverse events ,  a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event \r\neCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g. ,  record only liver failure or \r\nhepatitis rather than jaundice ,  asterixis ,  and elevated transaminases).  However ,  if a \r\nconstellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single \r\ndiagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting ,  each individual event should be recorded \r\non the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established ,  all previousl y \r\nreported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced \r\nby one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis ,  with a starting date that \r\ncorresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 80\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  5.3.5.3 Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events  \r\nIn general ,  adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g. ,  cascade events or \r\nclinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause ,  with the exception of \r\nsevere or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event \r\nthat is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent \r\nevent on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example :   \r\n  If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult ,  \r\nonly vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.  \r\n  If vomiting results in severe dehydration ,  both events should be reported separately \r\non the eCRF.  \r\n  If a severe gastrointes tinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure ,  both events should be \r\nreported separately on the eCRF.  \r\n  If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture ,  all three events should be \r\nreported separately on the eCRF.  \r\n  If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection ,   both events should be reported \r\nseparately on the eCRF.  \r\nAll adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is \r\nunclear as to whether the events are associated.  \r\n5.3.5.4  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  \r\nA persistent adverse  event is one that extends continuously ,  without resolution ,  between \r\npatient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the \r\nAdverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be \r\nrecorded at the time th e event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes \r\nmore severe ,  the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event \r\neCRF.  If the event becomes serious ,  it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately \r\n(i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section \r\n5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by \r\nchanging the event from \"non -serious\" to \"serious , \" providing the date that the event \r\nbecame serious ,  and com pleting all data fields related to serious adverse events.  \r\nA recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints \r\nand subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a \r\nseparate event on the Adve rse Event eCRF.  \r\n5.3.5.5  Abnormal Laboratory Values  \r\nNot every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result \r\nmust be reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of \r\nthe following criteria :   \r\n  Is ac companied by clinical symptoms   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 81\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    Results in a change in atezolizumab treatment (e.g. ,  dosage modification ,  treatment \r\ninterruption ,  or treatment discontinuation)  \r\n  Results in a medical intervention (e.g. ,  potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) \r\nor a change i n concomitant therapy  \r\n  Is clinically significant in the investigator s judgment  \r\nNote :   For oncology trials ,  certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse \r\nevents.  \r\nIt is the investigator s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and \r\nscientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory \r\nabnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  \r\nIf a clinically significant lab oratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome  \r\n(e.g. ,  ALP and bilirubin 5 \r\n ULN associated with cholestasis) ,  only the diagnosis (i.e. ,  \r\ncholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  \r\nIf a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is  not a sign of a disease or syndrome ,  \r\nthe abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  along with a \r\ndescriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g. ,  \r\n\"elevated potassium , \" as opposed to \"abnormal po tassium\").  If the laboratory \r\nabnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions ,  \r\nthe clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example ,  an elevated \r\nserum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded a s \"hyperkalemia.\"  \r\nObservations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit \r\nshould only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for \r\ndetails on recording persistent adverse events).  \r\n5.3.5.6  Abnormal V ital Sign Values  \r\nNot every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must \r\nbe reported as an adverse event if it is a change from baseline and meets any of the \r\nfollowing criteria :   \r\n  Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  \r\n  Results in a change in atezolizumab treatment (e.g. ,  dosage modification ,  treatment \r\ninterruption ,  or treatment discontinuation)  \r\n  Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  \r\n  Is clinically significant in the investigator s judgment  \r\nIt is the investigator s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific \r\njudgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality \r\nshould be class ified as an adverse event.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 82\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g. ,  \r\nhigh blood pressure) ,  only the diagnosis (e.g. ,  hypertension) should be recorded on \r\nthe Adverse Event eCRF.  \r\nObservations of the same cli nically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit \r\nshould only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for \r\ndetails on recording persistent adverse events).  \r\n5.3.5.7  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  \r\nThe finding of an elevated  ALT or AST (\r\n 3\r\nbaseline value) in combination with either an \r\nelevated total bilirubin (\r\n 2\r\nULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or \r\nother causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury \r\n(as defined by Hy's law).  Therefore ,  investigators must report as an adverse event the \r\noccurrence of either of the following :   \r\n  Treatment -emergent ALT or AST \r\n 3\r\nbaseline value in combination with total \r\nbilirubin \r\n 2\r\nULN (of which \r\n 35% is direct bilirubin)  \r\n  Treatment -emergent ALT or AST \r\n 3\r\nbaseline value in combination with clinical \r\njaundice  \r\nThe most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal \r\nlaboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRF (see Section 5.3.5.2 ) \r\nand reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of \r\nthe event) ,  either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see \r\nSection 5.4.2 ). \r\n5.3.5.8  Deaths  \r\nAll deaths that occur  during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see  \r\nSection 5.3.1 ) ,  regardless of relationship to study drug ,  must be recorded on the \r\nAdverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This \r\nincludes death attributed to progression of NSCLC.  \r\nDeath should be considered an outcome and not a di stinct event.  The event or \r\ncondition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the \r\nsingle medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally ,  only one such event \r\nshould be reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cann ot be ascertained at the \r\ntime of reporting ,  \"unexplained death\" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  \r\nIf the cause of death later becomes available (e.g. ,  after autopsy) ,  \"unexplained death\" \r\nshould be replaced by the established cause of death. Th e term \"sudden death\" should \r\nnot be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g. ,  \"sudden cardiac \r\ndeath\").  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g. ,  after autopsy) ,  \"unexplained \r\ndeath\" should be replaced by the established cause of death.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 83\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  If the death is attributed to progression of NSCLC ,  this is the only case when \"disease \r\nprogression\" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.   \r\nDeaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as \r\ndescribed in Sec tion 5.6. \r\n5.3.5.9  Preexisting Medical Conditions  \r\nA preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  \r\nSuch conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline \r\nConditions eCRF.  \r\nA preexisting me dical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the \r\nfrequency ,  severity ,  or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When \r\nrecording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  it is important to convey the concept \r\nthat the preexistin g condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g. ,  \r\n\"more frequent headaches\").  \r\n5.3.5.10  Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  \r\nDeterioration that is judged by the investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity o r \r\nfrequency or changed in nature (i.e. ,  deterioration beyond the expected pattern of progression of the \r\nunderlying disease) should be recorded as an adverse event.   \r\nWhen recording an unanticipated worsening of non -small cell lung cancer on the  \r\nAdverse Ev ent eCRF ,  it is important to convey the concept that the condition has  \r\nchanged by including applicable descriptors (e.g. ,  \"accelerated worsening of non -small cell lung \r\ncancer\").   \r\nEvents that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression  of the \r\nunderlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events ,  unless death is the \r\noutcome (see Section 5.3.5.8 ).  These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data \r\nonly.  In most cases ,  the expected pattern of progression will be based on RECI ST v1.1.  \r\nIn rare cases ,  the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic \r\ndeterioration.  However ,  every effort should be made to document progression through \r\nuse of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an ev ent is due to \r\ndisease progression/recurrence ,  it should be reported as an adverse event.  \r\n5.3.5.11  Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization  \r\nAny adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e. ,  inpatient admission to a hospital) \r\nor prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse \r\nevent (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ) ,  except as outlined \r\nbelow.   \r\nAn event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be \r\nreported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event :   \r\n  Hospitalization for respite care   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 84\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g. ,  for s tudy drug administration)  \r\n  Hospitalization for a preexisting condition ,  provided that all of the following criteria \r\nare met :   \r\nThe hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the \r\nstudy when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected \r\nnormal progression of the disease  \r\nThe patient has not experienced an adverse event  \r\n  Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer  \r\nAn event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not \r\nconsidered to be a serious adverse event ,  but should be reported as an adverse event \r\ninstead :   \r\n  Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient \r\ncare outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours  \r\n5.3.5.12  Adverse Events Associated with an Accidental Overdose or \r\nMedication Error in Drug Administration  \r\nAn overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the \r\ndose being studied.  Medication error :   Accidental deviation in the administration of a drug ,  \r\nin some cases ,  a medication error may be intercepted prior to administrati on of the drug.  \r\nAn overdose or incorrect administration of atezolizumab treatment is not itself an adverse \r\nevent ,  but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an \r\noverdose  ,  incorrect administration or medication error of study drug should be recorded on \r\nthe Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria or \r\nqualifies as an adverse event of special interest  ,  the event should be reported to the Sponsor \r\nimmediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours aft er learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). \r\n5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM \r\nINVESTIGATOR TO SPONSOR  \r\nCertain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate \r\nmeasures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.   The investigator must report \r\nsuch events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take \r\nplace more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list \r\nof events that the investigator must report to  the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning \r\nof the event ,  regardless of relationship to study drug :   \r\n  Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)  \r\n  Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)  \r\n  Pregnancies (see S ection 5.4.3 for further details)  \r\nFor serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest ,  the investigator must report \r\nnew significant follow -up information for these events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. ,   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 85\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant \r\ninformation includes the following :   \r\n  New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  \r\n  Significant new diagnostic test results  \r\n  Change in causality based on new information  \r\n  Change in the event s outcome ,  including recovery  \r\n  Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event  \r\nInvestigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse \r\nevents to the local health authority and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics \r\nCommittee (EC).  \r\n5.4.1  Emergency Medical Contacts  \r\nMedical Monitor Contact Information \r\nCRO Medical Monitor contact information :   \r\nMedical Monitor :    ,  M.D. (Primary)  \r\n Telephone Nos. :   +1-866-326-5053 or +1 -434-951-4082  \r\n Email :   ML39236@prahs.com  \r\nGenentech Medical Monitor contact information :   \r\nMedical Monitor :   (Secondary) ,  PA -C ,  MMSc ,  MBA  \r\nTelephone No. :   \r\nEmail :   \r\n5.4.2  Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and  \r\nAdverse Events of Special Interest  \r\n5.4.2.1  Events That Occur prior to Study Drug Initiation  \r\nAfter informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug ,  only \r\nserious adverse events ca used by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  \r\nThe Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided \r\nto investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee \r\nimmediately (i.e. ,  no more t han 24 hours after learning of the event) ,  either by faxing or \r\nby scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to \r\ninvestigators.  \r\n5.4.2.2  Events That Occur after Study Drug Initiation  \r\nAfter initiation of study drug ,  adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the last \r\ndose of atezolizumab (neoadjuvant or adjuvant ,  whichever occurs last).  See Table 5 for \r\nfull details.  Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be \r\nreported until 90 days after t he last dose of atezolizumab (neoadjuvant or adjuvant ,  \r\nwhichever occurs last).  Only serious adverse events associated with CT scans ,  blood  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 86\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  sample collection and optional biopsy at the time of disease progression/recurrence that \r\noccur after the 90 day repo rting window ,  but during the Surveillance period ,  will be \r\ncollected and reported (see Table 5 ). Investigators should record all case details that \r\ncan be gathered immediately (i.e. ,  within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the \r\nAdverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) \r\nsystem.  A report will be generated and sent to Safety Risk Management by the EDC \r\nsystem.  \r\nIn the event that the EDC system is unavailable ,  the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse \r\nEvent of Special Interest R eporting Form provided to investigators should be completed \r\nand submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours \r\nafter learning of the event) ,  either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using \r\nthe fax number or em ail address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is \r\navailable ,  all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.   \r\nInstructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur \r\n 90 days after the last dose \r\nof atezolizumab are provided in Section 5.6. \r\n5.4.3  Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies  \r\n5.4.3.1  Pregnancies in Female Patients  \r\nFemale patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed  \r\nConsent Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the \r\nstudy or within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab .  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy \r\nReporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee \r\nimmediately  (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) ,  either by \r\nfaxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address \r\nprovided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event \r\neCRF.  The investi gator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient ,  \r\ndiscussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring \r\nof the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse \r\nevents associated w ith the pregnancy (e.g. ,  an event in the fetus ,  an event in the mother \r\nduring or after the pregnancy ,  or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be \r\nreported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition ,  the investigator will submit a Clinical \r\nTrial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome \r\nof the pregnancy becomes available.   \r\n5.4.3.2  Abortions  \r\nA spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers \r\nabortions to be medicall y significant) ,  recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF ,  and reported to the \r\nSponsor immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). \r\nIf a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or \r\nembryofetal toxicity ,  the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event ,  recorded on the  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 87\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Adverse Event eCRF ,  and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after \r\nlearning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or elective abortion performed for reasons \r\nother than an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  \r\nAll abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy \r\nReporting Form.  \r\n5.4.3.3  Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects and Abortions  \r\nAny congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study \r\ndrug should be classified as a serious adverse event ,  recorded on the Adverse Event \r\neCRF ,  and reported to the Sponsor i mmediately (i.e. ,  no more than 24 hours after \r\nlearning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).  Any abortion should be reported in the same \r\nfashion (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant).  \r\n5.4.4  Reporting Requirements for Special Situations and   \r\nNon -Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Special  Situation  \r\nAfter initiation of study drug ,  special situations and adverse events associated with special \r\nsituations will be reported until 90 days after the final dose of study drug. Investigators \r\nshould record all case details that can be gathered on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF and submit \r\nthe report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system within 30 calendar days of \r\nawareness. A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the \r\nEDC system.  \r\n5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENTS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS  \r\n5.5.1  Investigator Follow -Up \r\nThe investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline \r\ngrade or better ,  the event is assessed as stable by the investigator ,  the patient is lost to \r\nfollow -up ,  or the patient withdraws consent.  Every  effort should be made to follow all \r\nserious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures \r\nuntil a final outcome can be reported.  \r\nDuring the adverse event reporting period (defined in Section 5.3.1 ) ,  resolution of advers e events \r\n(with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient s medical \r\nrecord to facilitate source data verification.  \r\nAll pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  \r\n5.5.2  Sponsor Follow -Up \r\nFor serious adverse events ,  adverse events of special interest ,  and pregnancies ,  the \r\nSponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone ,  fax ,  electronic mail ,  and/or a \r\nmonitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g. ,  from \r\nhosp ital discharge summaries ,  consultant reports ,  autopsy reports) in order to perform \r\nan independent medical assessment of the reported case.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 88\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVERSE EVENT \r\nREPORTING PERIOD  \r\nThe Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious \r\nadverse event or non -serious adverse event of special interest that occurs after the end \r\nof the adverse event  reporting period (defined as 90 days after the last dose of \r\nneoadjuvant or adjuvant atezolizumab ,  whichever occurs last; see Table 5 ) ,  if the event \r\nis believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  These events should be reported \r\nthrough use of th e Adverse Event eCRF.  However ,  if the EDC system is not available ,  \r\nthe investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee ,  either \r\nby faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of \r\nSpecial Interes t Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to \r\ninvestigators.  \r\n5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES ,   \r\nINVESTIGATORS ,  INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS ,  AND \r\nETHICS COMMITTEES  \r\nThe Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse event s and adverse events of \r\nspecial interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously \r\ncommunicate possible new safety findings to investigators ,  IRBs ,  ECs ,  and applicable \r\nhealth authorities based on applicable legislation.  \r\nTo determi ne reporting requirements for single adverse event cases ,  the Sponsor \r\nwill assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference \r\ndocument :  \r\n  Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure  \r\nThe Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cu mulative event \r\nfrequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the \r\napplicable reference document.  \r\nReporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality \r\nand seriousness ,  with allowance for upgra ding by the Sponsor as needed.  \r\n6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  \r\nThe objective of this study is to determine if atezolizumab 1200 mg q21d demonstrates \r\nefficacy in the neoadjuvant setting by producing a major pathologic response rate of at \r\nleast 15%; major pathologic response is defined as \r\n  10% of viable tumor cells \r\n(Hellmann et al. 2014).  Tumors without radiographic response ,  but which demonstrate a \r\nmajor pathologic response (Hellmann et al. 2014) will be counted as a response.  \r\nSafety of atezolizumab in this treatment setting will also be assessed.  \r\nDetails of the anal yses are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 89\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 90\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY  \r\nThe number of patients who enroll ,  discontinue ,  or complete the study will be \r\nsummarized.  Reasons for premature study withdrawal will be listed and summarized.  \r\nEnrollment and major protocol deviations will be listed and evaluated for their potential \r\neffects on the interpretation of study results.  \r\n6.3 SUMMARIES OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASELINE \r\nCHARACTERISTICS  \r\nDemographic information such as age and race will be tabulated.  Descriptive statistics ,  \r\nincluding means ,  standard deviations ,  and ranges for continuous p arameters ,  as well as \r\npercentages and frequencies for categorical parameters ,  will be presented.  Adverse \r\nevents ,  Grade 3/4 adverse events ,  and serious adverse events will be tabulated.   \r\n6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  \r\nThe primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all enrolled patients who have \r\nreceived at least one dose of the study drug and who do not have EGFR or ALK mutant \r\ntumors (efficacy population).  \r\n6.4.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  \r\nThe effectiveness of the atezolizumab will be assessed by major pathologic response \r\nrate in the efficacy population ,  excluding patients who have not received surgery after \r\nneoadjuvant treatment with atezolizumab.  A statistical test of a single proportion of \r\nmajor pathologic r esponse rate will be tested against the alternative that the rate is 15%.  \r\nIf the null hypothesis is rejected then this is evidence that the response rate exceeds 5% \r\nwhen atezolizumab is given before resection.  The one -sided 95% confidence interval \r\n(CI) f or major pathologic response will be reported.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 91\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\n  \r\n6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES  \r\nThe safety analyses will include all enrolled patients who have received at least one \r\ndose of study drug.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 92\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   \r\n6.7 INTERIM ANALYSES  \r\n6.7.1  Planned Interim Analyses  \r\nThe interim analyses described below will be performed.  The study will continue during \r\nthe interim analyses.  \r\n6.7.1.1  Planned Interim Safety Analysis  \r\nThere is not yet extensive data on the safety of thoracic surgical resections after \r\ntreatment with checkpo int inhibitors.  Therefore ,  after the first 30 patients who complete \r\nprotocol -specified atezolizumab treatment and have undergone the planned surgical \r\nresection of their tumor ,  the patient cohort will be evaluated for tolerability and safety of \r\nthe neoadju vant regimen.  If ,  at the time of the safety interim analysis ,  three or more \r\npatients have experienced Grade 5 adverse events related to protocol treatment ,  then \r\nthe study will be discontinued.  \r\n6.7.1.2  Planned Interim Efficacy Analysis  \r\nThe study includes o ne interim analysis to assess futility after 90 patients are assessed.  \r\nThe non -binding futility interim boundary satisfies conditional power at a cut -off of 0.30.  \r\n6.7.2  Optional Interim Analyses  \r\nGiven the hypothesis -generating nature of this study ,  the S ponsor may choose to \r\nconduct additional interim efficacy analyses.  The decision to conduct an optional interim \r\nanalysis ,  and the timing of the analysis ,  will be documented in the Sponsor s trial master \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 93\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  file prior to the conduct of the interim analysis.  T he interim analysis will be performed \r\nand interpreted by Sponsor study team personnel.  \r\n7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  \r\n7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  \r\nThe Sponsor will supply eCRF specifications for this study A contract research \r\norganization (CRO) will be re sponsible for the data management of this study ,  including \r\nquality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through \r\nuse of eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event \r\nof discrepant data ,   the CRO will request data clarification from the sites ,  which the sites \r\nwill resolve electronically in the EDC system.   \r\nThe Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study.  The CRO will \r\nproduce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be \r\nperformed on the data. Data will be periodically transferred electronically from th e CRO \r\nto the Sponsor ,  and the Sponsor s standard procedures will be used to handle and \r\nprocess the electronic transfer of these data.   \r\nCentral laboratory data will be sent directly to the Sponsor and/or CRO ,  using the \r\nSponsor s and/or CRO s standard proce dures to handle and process the electronic \r\ntransfer of these data.  \r\n  \r\neCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system s audit trail.  \r\nSystem backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data \r\nwill be consistent with the Sponsor s standard procedures.  \r\n7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE RE PORT FORMS  \r\neCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites \r\nwill receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.   \r\neCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in  \r\naccordance with instructions from the Sponsor.  \r\nAll eCRFs should be completed by designated ,  trained site staff.  eCRFs should be \r\nreviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  \r\nAt the end of the study ,  the investigator will  receive patient data for his or her site in a \r\nreadable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  \r\nAcknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 94\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION  \r\nStudy monitors will perform ongoing source  data verification to confirm that critical \r\nprotocol data (i.e. ,  source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are \r\naccurate ,  complete ,  and verifiable from source documents.  \r\nSource documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and \r\ndocumented for the first time.  They include ,  but are not limited to ,  hospital records ,  \r\nclinical and office charts ,  laboratory notes ,  memoranda ,  patient -reported outcom es ,  \r\nevaluation checklists ,  pharmacy dispensing records ,  recorded data from automated \r\ninstruments ,  copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate \r\nand complete ,  microfiche ,  photographic negatives ,  microfilm or magnetic media  ,  imaging ,  \r\npatient files ,  and records kept at pharmacies ,  laboratories ,  and medico -technical \r\ndepartments involved in a clinical trial.  \r\nBefore study initiation ,  the types of source documents that are to be generated will be \r\nclearly defined in the Trial Moni toring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be \r\nentered directly into the eCRFs (i.e. ,  no prior written or electronic record of the data) and \r\nconsidered source data.  \r\nSource documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data \r\nentered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per \r\nthe policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. \r\nTo facilitate source data verification ,  the investigators and institutions must provide the \r\nSponsor direct acces s to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related \r\nmonitoring ,  Sponsor audits ,  and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow \r\ninspection by applicable health authorities.  \r\n7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS  \r\nWhen clinical observations are entere d directly into a study site s computerized medical \r\nrecord system (i.e. ,  in lieu of original hardcopy records) ,  the electronic record can serve \r\nas the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health \r\nauthority requirements pertain ing to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An \r\nacceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry \r\nof data.  If original data are modified ,  the system should maintain a viewable audit trail \r\nthat shows the or iginal data as well as the reason for the change ,  name of the person \r\nmaking the change ,  and date of the change.  \r\n7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS  \r\nRecords and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of \r\nIMP ,  including eCRFs ,  electronic PRO data (if applicable) ,  Informed Consent Forms ,  \r\nlaboratory test results ,  medication inventory records  ,  and images  ,  must be retained by the \r\nPrincipal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 95\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities ,  \r\nwhichever is longer.  After that period of time ,  the documents may be destroyed ,  subject \r\nto local regulations.   \r\nNo records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Wri tten \r\nnotification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to \r\nanother party or moving them to another location.  \r\nThe Sponsor will retain study data for 25 years after the final study results have been reported or \r\nfor the length of  time required by relevant national or local health authorities ,  whichever is \r\nlonger.  \r\n8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  \r\n8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \r\nThis study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for Good \r\nClinical Practice a nd the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki ,  or the laws and \r\nregulations of the country in which the research is conducted ,  whichever affords the \r\ngreater protection to the individual.  The study will comply with the requirements of the \r\nICH E2A guideli ne (Clinical Safety Data Management :   Definitions and Standards for \r\nExpedited Reporting).

Studies conducted in the European Union or \r\nEuropean Economic Area will comply with the E.U. Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC).  \r\n8.2 INFORMED CONSENT  \r\nThe Sponsor s sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent  \r\nForms such as a Child s Informed Assent Form or Mobile Nursing Informed Consent \r\nForm ,  if applicable) will be provided to each site.  If applicable ,  it will be provided in a \r\ncertified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and \r\napprove any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms \r\nor any alternate consent forms proposed by the site (collectively ,  the \"Consent Forms \") \r\nbefore IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/EC\r\n approved Consent Forms must be \r\nprovided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local \r\nrequirements.  \r\nIf applicable ,  the Informed Consent Form will contain separate sections for any optional \r\nprocedures.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the \r\nobjectives ,  methods ,  and potential risks associated with each optional procedure.  \r\nPatients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may with draw their \r\nconsent at any time for any reason.  A separate ,  specific signature will be required to \r\ndocument a patient's agreement to participate in optional procedures.  Patients who \r\ndecline to participate will not provide a separate signature.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 96\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  The Consent  Forms must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient s legally \r\nauthorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history or \r\nclinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that \r\nwritten informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  \r\nThe Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures \r\nor when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient \r\nto participat e.  The final revised IRB/EC -approved Consent Forms must be provided to \r\nthe Sponsor for health authority submission purposes.  \r\nPatients must be re -consented to the most current version of the Consent Forms (or to a \r\nsignificant new information/findings adden dum in accordance with applicable laws and \r\nIRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study.  For any updated or revised \r\nConsent Forms ,  the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the \r\ninformed consent process and that written  informed consent was obtained using the \r\nupdated/revised Consent Forms for continued participation in the study.  \r\nA copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient s \r\nlegally authorized representative.  All signed and dated Co nsent Forms must remain in \r\neach patient s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study \r\nmonitors at any time.  \r\nEach Consent Form may also include patient authorization to allow use and disclosure \r\nof personal health informati on in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability \r\nand Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.  If the site utilizes a separate Authorization \r\nForm for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information \r\nunder the HIPAA regulati ons ,  the review ,  approval ,  and other processes outlined above \r\napply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies.  \r\n8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE  \r\nThis protocol ,  the Informed Consent Forms ,  any informati on to be given to the patient ,  \r\nand relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the Principal \r\nInvestigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  In \r\naddition ,  any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  \r\nThe Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of \r\nthe study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the \r\nrequirements ,  policies ,  and procedures established by the IRB/EC.   Investigators are \r\nalso responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see \r\nSection 9.6). \r\nIn addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor ,  \r\ninvestigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the \r\nlocal health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 97\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  or other safety -related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible \r\nfor ensuring that such reports are reviewed and p rocessed in accordance with health \r\nauthority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC ,  and \r\narchived in the site s study file.  \r\n8.4 CONFIDENTIALITY  \r\nThe Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enroll ed in the \r\nstudy through assignment of a unique patient identification number.  This means that \r\npatient names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location.  \r\nPatient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed \r\nto third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate \r\nauthorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the \r\npatient ,  unless permitted or required by law.  \r\nMedical information may be given to a patient s personal physician or other appropriate \r\nmedical personnel responsible for the patient s welfare ,  for treatment purposes.  \r\n \r\nData generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by \r\nrepresentatives of national and local health authorities ,  Sponsor monitors ,  \r\nrepresentatives ,  and collaborators ,  and the IRB/EC for each study site ,  as appropriate.  \r\n8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  \r\nInvestigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient ,  accurate financial information in \r\naccordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate \r\nfinancial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities.   \r\nInvestigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the \r\ncourse of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study.  \r\n9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION ,  MONITORING ,  AND  \r\nADMINISTRATION  \r\n9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION  \r\nThe investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of \r\nthe study to be fully documented ,  including ,  but not limited to ,  the protocol ,  protocol \r\namendments ,  Informed Consent Forms ,  and documentation of IRB/E C and \r\ngovernmental approval.  In addition ,  at the end of the study ,  the investigator will receive \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 98\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  the patient data ,  including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to \r\ndata.  \r\n9.2 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  \r\nThe investigator should document and e xplain any protocol deviations.  The investigator \r\nshould promptly report any deviations that might have an impact on patient safety and \r\ndata integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC \r\npolicies and procedures.  The Spon sor will review all protocol deviations and assess \r\nwhether any represent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and require \r\nreporting to health authorities.  As per the Sponsor's standard operating procedures ,  \r\nprospective requests to deviate  from the protocol ,  including requests to waive protocol \r\neligibility criteria ,  are not allowed.  \r\n9.3 SITE INSPECTIONS  \r\nSite visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for \r\ninspection of study data ,  subjects  medical records ,  and eCRFs.  The investigator will \r\npermit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors ,  representatives ,  and \r\ncollaborators; and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  \r\n9.4 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE  \r\nThis study will be spo nsored and managed by Genentech ,  Inc. (a member of the Roche \r\nGroup).  Approximately 15 sites in the U.S. will participate in the study ,  and \r\napproximately 180 patients will be enrolled.  \r\nEnrollment will occur through an interactive voice/web -based response system (IxRS).   \r\nCentral laboratory facilities will be used for study assessments throughout the study \r\n(e.g. ,  PD -L1 testing).  Accredited local laboratories will be used for routine monitoring; \r\nlocal laboratory ranges will be collected.  \r\nA Data Review Comm ittee will be the advisory committee ,  and study status will be \r\ndiscussed on an ongoing basis.  \r\nA contract research (CRO) will support coordination and medical monitoring activities.  \r\n9.5 PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE \r\nSECRETS  \r\nRegardless of the outcome of a trial ,  the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providing \r\ninformation on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public ,  both at scientific \r\ncongresses and in peer -reviewe d journals. The Sponsor will comply with all \r\nrequirements for publication of study results.  For more information ,  refer to the Roche \r\nGlobal Policy on Sharing of Clinical Study Information at the following Web site :   \r\n _on_sharing_of_clinical_study_informatio \r\nn.pdf   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 99\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses.  For all \r\nclinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application \r\nhas been filed or approve d in any country ,  the Sponsor aims to submit a journal \r\nmanuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of \r\nthe respective Clinical Study Report.  In addition ,  for all clinical trials in patients involving \r\nan IMP fo r which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any \r\ncountry ,  the Sponsor aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and \r\nexploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound.  \r\nThe investigator  must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior \r\nto submission for publication or presentation.  This allows the Sponsor to protect \r\nproprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other \r\nstudies that may not yet be available to the investigator.  \r\nIn accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice ,  the Sponsor will generally \r\nsupport publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center \r\ndata.  In this case ,  a coordinating i nvestigator will be designated by mutual agreement.  \r\nAuthorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International \r\nCommittee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  Any formal publication \r\nof the study in which contribution of  Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional \r\nmonitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the \r\nappropriate Sponsor personnel.  \r\nAny inventions and resulting patents ,  improvements ,  and/or know -how originating from \r\nthe use of  data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened \r\nproperty of the Sponsor ,  except where agreed otherwise.  \r\n9.6 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  \r\nAny protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor.  Protocol amendments will \r\nbe submitted to the  IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local \r\nregulatory requirements.  \r\nApproval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally \r\nrequired) before implementation of any changes ,  except for changes necessary to \r\nelimina te an immediate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or \r\nadministrative aspects only (e.g. ,  change in Medical Monitor or contact information).    \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 100\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  10.

New response evaluation criteria in solid tumors :   \r\nRevised RECIST guideline (Version 1.1). Eur J Cancer 2009;45 : 228\r\n 47. \r\n2 For consistency within this document ,  the section numbers and cross -referen ces to other \r\nsections within the article have been deleted and minor formatting changes have been made.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 124\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  MEASURABILITY OF TUMOR AT BASELINE  \r\nDEFIN ITIONS  \r\nAt baseline ,  tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -\r\nmeasurable as follows.  \r\na. Measurable Tumor Lesions  \r\nTumor Lesions.   Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension  \r\n(longest diameter in the plane of  measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of :   \r\n  10 mm by CT or MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 \r\nmm) \r\n  10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be \r\naccurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  \r\n  20 mm by chest X -ray \r\nb. Non-Measurable Tumor Lesions  \r\nNon-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (lon gest diameter \r\n 10 mm or \r\npathological lymph nodes with \r\n 10 to \r\n 15 mm short axis) ,  as well as truly non -\r\nmeasurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal \r\ndisease ,  ascites ,  pleural or pericardial effusion ,  inflammatory breast  disease ,  \r\nlymphangitic involvement of skin or lung ,  peritoneal spread ,  and abdominal \r\nmasses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not \r\nmeasurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  \r\nc. Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Meas urability  \r\nBone lesions ,  cystic lesions ,  and lesions previously treated with local therapy require \r\nparticular comment ,  as outlined below.  \r\nAppendix 6  \r\n     Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nBone lesions :   \r\n  Bone scan ,  positron emission tomography (PET) scan ,  or plain films are not \r\nconsidered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However ,  \r\nthese techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone \r\nlesions.  \r\n  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions ,  with identifiable soft tissue \r\ncomponents ,  that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as \r\nCT or MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component \r\nmeets the definitio n of measurability described above.  \r\n  Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 125\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Cystic lesions :   \r\n  Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not \r\nbe considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since \r\nthey are ,  by definition ,  simple cysts.  \r\n  Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered \r\nmeasurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  \r\nHowever ,  if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient ,  these are preferred \r\nfor selection as target lesions.  \r\nLesions with prior local treatment :   \r\n  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to \r\nother loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has \r\nbeen demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the \r\nconditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable.  \r\nTARGET LESIONS :   SPECIFICATIONS BY METHODS OF MEASUREMENTS \r\na. Measurement of Lesions  \r\nAll measurements should b e recorded in metric notation ,  using calipers if clinically \r\nassessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the \r\ntreatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  \r\nb. Method of Assessment  \r\nThe s ame method of assessment and the same technique should be used to \r\ncharacterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during study.  Imaging -\r\nbased evaluation should always be the preferred option.  \r\nClinical Lesions.   Clinical lesions will be considered measurable only when they are \r\nsuperficial and \r\n 10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. ,  skin nodules).  For \r\nthe case of skin lesions ,  documentation by color photography ,  including a ruler to \r\nestimate the siz e of the lesion is suggested.  \r\nChest X -Ray.   Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray ,  particularly when progression is \r\nan important endpoint ,  since CT is more sensitive than X -ray ,  particularly in identifying  Appendix 6  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 126\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6       Re \r\nnew lesions.   However ,  lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they \r\nare clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  \r\nCT ,  MRI.   CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions \r\nselected for response assessment.  This guide line has defined measurability of lesions \r\non CT scan on the basis of the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  \r\nWhen CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm ,  the minimum size for a \r\nmeasurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness .  MRI is also acceptable.  \r\nIf prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with IV \r\ncontrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency ,  the decision as to whether a non -\r\ncontrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to  evaluate the patient at baseline \r\nand during the study should be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the \r\nanatomic location of the disease.  For patients who develop contraindications to contrast \r\nafter baseline contrast CT is done ,  the decision  as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI \r\n(enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type \r\nand the anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized to allow for \r\ncomparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each cas e should be discussed with the \r\nradiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and ,  if not ,   \r\nthe patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward .  Care must be \r\ntaken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality and interpretation of \r\nnontarget disease or new lesions since the same lesion may appear to have a different  \r\nsize using a new modality.  \r\nUltrasound.   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be \r\nused as a method of measurement.  \r\nEndoscopy ,  Laparoscopy ,  Tumor Markers ,  Cytology ,  Histology.   The utilization of \r\nthese techniques for objective  tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised.  \r\nTUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION  \r\nASSESSMENT OF OVERALL TUMOR BURDEN AND MEASURABLE \r\nDISEASE  \r\nTo assess objective response or future progression ,  it is necessary to estimate \r\nthe overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for \r\nsubsequent measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at \r\nleast one measurable lesi on ,  as detailed above.  \r\nBASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON -TARGET LESIONS  \r\nWhen more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline ,  all lesions up to a \r\nmaximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in \r\nSolid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 127\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  representative of all inv olved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be \r\nrecorded and measured at baseline.  This means in instances where patients have \r\nonly one or two  \r\n      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\norgan sites involved ,  a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two sites) ,  \r\nrespectively ,  will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will \r\nbe recorded as non -measurable lesions (even if the size is \r\n 10 mm by CT scan).  \r\nTarget lesions should b e selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest \r\ndiameter) and be representative of all involved organs but ,  additionally ,  should lend \r\nthemselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that ,  on \r\noccasion ,  the largest lesio n does not lend itself to reproducible measurement ,  in which \r\ncircumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be \r\nselected.  \r\nLymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that \r\nmay be visible by ima ging even if not involved by tumor.  As noted above ,  pathological \r\nnodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet \r\nthe criterion of a short axis of \r\n 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes \r\nwill contribute  to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally \r\nused by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally \r\nreported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan ,  \r\nthis is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial ,  \r\nsagittal ,  or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example ,  an \r\nabdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm\r\n 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and \r\nqualifies as a malignant ,  measurable node.  In this example ,  20 mm should be recorded \r\nas the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis \r\n 10 mm \r\nbut \r\n 15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis \r\n10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  \r\nLesions irradiated within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may not be counted as target \r\nlesions.  \r\nA sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions ,  short axis for nodal lesions) for all \r\ntarget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  If lymph \r\nnodes are to be included in the sum ,  then ,  as noted above ,  only the short axis is added \r\ninto the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a refere nce to further \r\ncharacterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  \r\nAll other lesions (or sites of disease) ,  including pathological lymph nodes ,  should be  \r\nidentified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at ba seline.  Measurements  Appendix 6  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 128\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  are not required and these lesions should be followed as  present ,    absent ,   or in rare  \r\ncases  unequivocal progression.   \r\nIn addition ,  it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ \r\nas a single item on t he Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g. ,   multiple enlarged pelvic lymph \r\nnodes  or  multiple liver metastases ).  \r\n      Re \r\nRESPONSE CRITERIA  \r\na. Evaluation of Target Lesions  \r\nThis section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor \r\nresponse for target lesions.  \r\n  Complete response (CR) :   disappearance of all target lesions  \r\n -  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have \r\nreductio n in short axis to \r\n 10 mm.  \r\n  Partial response (PR) :   at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target \r\nlesions ,  taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  \r\n  Progressive disease (PD) :   at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of \r\ntarget les ions ,  taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir) ,  including \r\nbaseline  \r\n -  In addition to the relative increase of 20% ,  the sum must also demonstrate an \r\nabsolute increase of at least 5 mm.  \r\n -  The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered p rogression.  \r\n  Stable disease (SD) :   neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient \r\nincrease to qualify for PD ,  taking as reference the smallest sum on study  \r\nb. Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions  \r\nLymph Nodes.   Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual \r\nshort axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the \r\nbaseline examination) ,  even if the nodes regress to \r\n 10 mm on study.  This means that \r\nwhen lymph nodes ar e included as target lesions ,  the sum of lesions may not be zero \r\neven if CR criteria are met since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis \r\n10 mm.  \r\nTarget Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure.   While on study ,  all lesions \r\n(nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements \r\nrecorded at each subsequent evaluation ,  even when very small (e.g. ,  2 mm).  However ,  \r\nsometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline \r\nbecome so faint on CT scan  that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an \r\nexact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs ,  \r\nit is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows :   Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in \r\nSolid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 129\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6    If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the  lesion has likely disappeared ,  the \r\nmeasurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  \r\n  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to \r\nmeasure ,  a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and BML (below \r\nmeasurable limit) should be ticked.  (Note :   It is less likely that this rule will be \r\nused for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and \r\nare frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however ,  if a \r\nlymph node is believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too small to \r\nmeasure ,  a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as \r\nwell and BML should also be ticked.)  Appendix 6 sponse Eval uation Criteria in \r\nSolid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  I nc. 130\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6      Re \r\nTo reiterate ,  however ,  if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure ,  that should  \r\nbe recorded ,  even if it is below 5 mm ,  and ,  in that ca se ,  BML should not be ticked.  \r\nLesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non -nodal lesions fragment ,  \r\nthe longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate \r\nthe target lesion sum.  Similarly ,  as lesions coalesce ,  a pl ane between them may be \r\nmaintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each \r\nindividual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer \r\nseparable ,  the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal \r\nlongest diameter for the coalesced lesion.  \r\nc. Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  \r\nThis section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response \r\nfor the group of non -target lesions.  Although some non -target lesions may actually be \r\nmeasurable ,  they need not be measured and ,  instead ,  should be assessed only \r\nqualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol.  \r\n  CR :   disappearance of all non -target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of \r\ntumor marker level)  \r\n  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (\r\n 10 mm short axis).  \r\n  Non-CR/Non -PD :   persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or (if \r\napplicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  \r\n  PD :   unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  \r\n -  The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.  \r\nd. Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease  \r\nWhen the Patient Also Has Measurable Disease.   In this setting ,  to achieve \r\nunequivocal progression on the basis of the non -target disease ,  there must be an overall \r\nlevel of substantial worsen ing in non -target disease in a magnitude that ,  even in the \r\npresence of SD or PR in target disease ,  the overall tumor burden has increased \r\nsufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or \r\nmore non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression \r\nstatus. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target \r\ndisease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  \r\nWhen the Patient Ha s Only Non -Measurable Disease.   This circumstance arises in \r\nsome Phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  \r\nThe same general concepts apply here as noted above; however ,  in this instance ,  there \r\nis no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in \r\nnon-measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in \r\nSolid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 131\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  easily quantified (by definition :   if all lesions are truly non -measurable) ,  a useful test that \r\ncan be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the  \r\n      Re \r\nincrease in overall disease burden based on the change in non -measurable disease is \r\ncomparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for  \r\nmeasurable disease; that is ,  an increase in tumor burden representing an additional \r\n73% increase in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter in a \r\nmeasurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from  trace  to \r\n large  or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread or may be \r\ndescribed in protocols as  sufficient to require a change in therapy.   If unequivocal \r\nprogression is seen ,  the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that \r\npoint.  Although it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable \r\ndisease ,  the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore ,  the \r\nincrease must be substantial.  \r\ne. New Lesions  \r\nThe appearance of new malignant lesion s denotes disease progression; therefore ,  some \r\ncomments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for \r\nthe identification of new radiographic lesions; however ,  the finding of a new lesion \r\nshould be unequivocal ,  that is ,  not attributable to differences in scanning technique ,  \r\nchange in imaging modality ,  or findings thought to represent something other than tumor \r\n(for example ,  some  new  bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting \r\nlesions).  This is particularly i mportant when the patient s baseline lesions show PR or \r\nCR.  For example ,  necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a \r\n new  cystic lesion ,  which it is not.  \r\nA lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at  \r\nbaseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  \r\nIf a new lesion is equivocal ,  for example because of its small size ,  continued therapy and \r\nfollow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm \r\nthere is definitely a new lesion ,  then progression should be declared using the date of \r\nthe initial scan.  \r\nEVALUATION OF RESPONSE  \r\na. Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  \r\nIt is assumed that at each protocol -specified timepoint ,  a response assessment occurs.  \r\nTable 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculatio n at each \r\ntimepoint for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.   \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 132\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  When patients have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease only ,  Table 2 is to \r\nbe used.  \r\nAppendix 6  \r\n   Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nTable 1  :   Timepoint Response :   Patients with Target Lesions \r\n(with or without Non -Target Lesions)  \r\nTarget Lesions  Non-Target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall \r\nResponse  \r\nCR CR No CR \r\nCR Non-CR/non -PD No PR \r\nCR Not evaluated  No PR \r\nPR Non-PD or not all \r\nevaluated  No PR \r\nSD Non-PD or not \r\nall evaluated  No SD \r\nNot all evaluated  Non-PD No NE \r\nPD Any Yes or no  PD \r\nAny PD Yes or no  PD \r\nAny Any Yes PD \r\nCR\r\n complete response; NE\r\n not evaluable; PD\r\n progressive disease; PR\r\n partial \r\nresponse; SD\r\n stable disease.  \r\nTable 2 :   Timepoint Response :   Patients with Non -Target Lesions \r\nOnly  \r\nNon-Target Lesions  New Lesions  Overall Response  \r\nCR No CR \r\nNon-CR/non -PD No Non-CR/non -PD a \r\nNot all evaluated  No NE \r\nUnequivocal PD  Yes or no  PD \r\nAny Yes PD \r\nCR\r\n complete response; NE\r\n not evaluable; PD\r\n progressive disease. a \r\n Non -CR/non -PD  is preferred over  stable disease  for non -target \r\ndisease since stable disease is increasingly used as an endpoint for \r\nassessment of efficacy in some trials; thus ,  assigning  stable disease  \r\nwhen no lesions can be measured is not advised.  Appendix 6 sponse Evaluation Criteria in \r\nSolid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc. 133\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  b. Missing Assessments and Not -Evaluable Designation  \r\nWhen no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint ,  the patient is not \r\nevaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an \r\nassessment ,  usually the case i s also considered not evaluable at that timepoint ,  unless a \r\nconvincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) \r\nwould not change the assigned timepoint response.  This would be most likely to happen \r\nin the case of PD.  For example ,  if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three \r\nmeasured lesions and ,  during the study ,  only two lesions were assessed ,  but those gave   \r\n134/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   Appendix 6     Response Evaluation Criteria in \r\nSolid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\na sum of 80 mm; the patient will have achieved PD status ,  regardless of the contribution \r\nof the missing lesion.  \r\nIf one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done \r\nor the scan could not be assessed because of poor image qua lity or obstructed view ,  the \r\nresponse for target lesions should be  unable to assess  since the patient is not \r\nevaluable.  Similarly ,  if one or more non -target lesions are not assessed ,  the response \r\nfor non -target lesions should be  unable to assess  excep t where there is clear \r\nprogression.  Overall response would be  unable to assess  if either the target response \r\nor the non -target response is  unable to assess ,   except where this is clear evidence of \r\nprogression as this equates with the case being not eva luable at that timepoint.  \r\nc. Best Overall Response :   All Timepoints  \r\nThe best overall response is determined once all data for the patient is known ,  and is \r\ninterpreted as in Table 3 .  Complete or partial responses may be claimed if the criteria \r\nfor each are  met at a subsequent time point  >=  4 weeks later.     \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech  ,  Inc. 135\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Appendix 6  \r\n      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nTable 3 :   Best Overall Response When Confirmation Is Required  \r\nOverall Response at First \r\nTimepoint  Overall Response at \r\nSubsequent Timepoint  Best Overall Response  \r\nCR  CR  CR  \r\nCR  PR  SD ,  PD ,  or PR a  \r\nCR  SD  SD ,  provided minimum duration \r\nfor SD was met; otherwise ,  PD  \r\nCR  PD  SD ,  provided minimum duration \r\nfor SD was met; otherwise ,  PD  \r\nCR  NE  SD ,  provided minimum duration \r\nfor SD was met; otherwise ,  NE  \r\nPR  CR  PR  \r\nPR  PR  PR  \r\nPR  SD  SD  \r\nPR  PD  SD ,  provided minimum duration  \r\nfor SD was met; otherwise ,  PD  \r\nPR  NE  SD ,  provided minimum duration \r\nfor SD was met; otherwise ,  NE  \r\nNE  NE  NE  \r\nCR  \r\n complete response; NE  \r\n not evaluable; PD  \r\n progressive disease; PR  \r\n partial response; \r\nSD  \r\n stable disease.  \r\na If a CR is truly met at the first timepoint ,  any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint ,  even \r\ndisease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline ,  qualifies as PD at that point (since disease \r\nmust have reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whe ther the minimum \r\nduration for SD was met.  However ,  sometimes CR may be claimed when subsequent scans \r\nsuggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR ,  not CR ,  at the \r\nfirst timepoint.  Under these circumstances ,  the original C R should be changed to PR and the \r\nbest response is PR.  \r\n  \r\nd. Special Notes on Response Assessment   \r\nWhen nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to \r\n normal  size (\r\n  10 mm) ,  they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This \r\nmeasurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to \r\noverst ate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted \r\nearlier ,  this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of  zero  on the CRF.   \r\n136/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6   Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of trea tment \r\nwithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as \r\n symptomatic deterioration.   Every effort should be made to document objective \r\nprogression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is no t a \r\ndescriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The \r\nobjective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target \r\nand non -target disease as shown in Tables 1\r\n 3.  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc.  \r\nAppendix 6  \r\n    Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (cont.)  \r\nFor equivocal findings of progression (e.g. ,  very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic \r\nchanges or necrosis in existing lesions) ,  treatment may continue until the next \r\nschedu led assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment progression is confirmed ,  \r\nthe date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.  \r\nIf a patient undergoes an excisional biopsy or other appropriate approach (e.g. ,  multiple \r\npass es with large core needle) of a new lesion or an existing solitary progressive lesion \r\nthat following serial sectioning and pathological examination reveals no evidence of \r\nmalignancy (e.g. ,  inflammatory cells ,  fibrosis ,  etc.) ,  then the new lesion or solitar y \r\nprogressive lesion will not constitute disease progression.  \r\nIn studies for which patients with advanced disease are eligible (i.e. ,  primary disease still \r\nor partially present) ,  the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or non -target \r\nlesion ,  as appropriate.  This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of CR  if the primary \r\ntumor is still present but not evaluated as a target or non -target lesion.    \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech  ,  Inc. 137\r\n/Protocol ML39236 ,  Version 6  Appendix 7  \r\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  \r\nGrade  Description  \r\n0 Fully active ,  able to carry on all predisease performance without restriction  \r\n1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out \r\nwork of a light or sedentary nature; e.g. ,  light housework or office work  \r\n2 Ambulatory and capable of all self -care but unable to carry out any work activities; \r\nup and about \r\n 50% of waking hours  \r\n3 Capable of only limited self -care ,  confined to a bed or chair \r\n 50% of waking hours  \r\n4 Completely disabled; cannot carry on any self -care; totally confined to bed or chair  \r\n5 Dead  \r\nAtezolizumab  Genentech ,  Inc.  \r\nAppendix 8 Anaphylaxis Precautions  \r\nEQUIPMENT NEEDED  \r\n  Monitoring devices :   ECG monitor ,  blood pressure monitor ,  oxygen saturation \r\nmonitor ,  and thermometer  \r\n  Oxygen  \r\n  Epinephrine for intramuscular (preferred route) ,  subcutaneous ,  intravenous ,  or \r\nendotracheal use in accordance with standard practice  \r\n  Antihistamines  \r\n  Corticosteroids  \r\n  Intravenous infusion solutions ,  tubing ,  catheters ,  and tape  \r\nPROCEDURES  \r\nIn the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction during study drug administration  ,  the \r\nfollowing procedures should be performed :   \r\n1.

Additional tests ,  such as autoimmune \r\nserology or biopsies ,  should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology  ,  \r\nwhen clinically indicated .  \r\nAlthough most immune -related adverse events observed with atezolizumab  have been \r\nmild and self -limiting ,  such events  should be recognized early and treated promptly to \r\navoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not have an \r\nimmediate therapeutic effect ,  and in severe cases ,  immune -related toxicities may require \r\nacute management with topical  corticosteroids ,  systemic corticosteroids ,  or other \r\nimmunosuppressive agents.   \r\nThe investigator should consider the benefit\r\n risk balance for a given patient prior to \r\nfurther administration of atezolizumab.  In patients who have met the criteria for \r\nperma nent discontinuation ,  resumption of atezolizumab may be considered if the patient \r\nis deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune -related event.  Patients can \r\nbe re -challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both \r\nthe investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.   \r\nMANAGEMENT GUIDELINES   \r\nPULMONARY EVENTS  \r\nDyspnea ,  cough ,  fatigue ,  hypoxia ,  pneumonitis ,  and pulmonary infiltrates have been \r\nassociated with the administration of atezolizumab.  Patients will be assessed for \r\npulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study and will also have computed \r\ntomography ( CT) scans of the chest performed at every tumor assessment.    \r\nAll pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported \r\netiologies such as pneumonia or other infection ,  lymphangitic carcinomatosis ,  pulmonary \r\nembolism ,  heart failure ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ,  or pulmonary \r\nhypertension.

Patients can be re -challenged with \r\natezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both the investigator (or an \r\nappropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.  \r\nINFUSION -RELATED REACTIONS AND CYTOKINE -RELEASE SYNDROME  \r\nNo premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  \r\nHowever ,  patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) or cytokine -release \r\nsyndrome (CRS) with atezolizumab may receive medication with antihistamines  ,  anti -\r\npyretics ,  and/ or analgesics (e.g. ,  acetaminophen).  For subsequent cycles ,  IRRs should \r\nbe managed according to institutional guidelines.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited \r\nin treating atezoliz umab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing \r\nagranulocytosis.  \r\nIRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have been \r\nreported with atezolizumab.  These reactions ,  which are thought to be due to release of cytoki nes \r\nand/or other chemical mediators ,  occur within 24 hours of atezolizumab administration and are \r\ngenerally mild to moderate in severity.  \r\nCRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune therapy \r\nthat results in activatio n or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune \r\neffector cells.  Symptoms can be progressive ,  always include fever at the onset ,  and may include \r\nhypotension ,  capillary leak (hypoxia) ,  and end -organ dysfunction (Lee et al. 2019).  CRS h as \r\nbeen well documented with chimeric antigen receptor T -cell therapies and bispecific T -cell \r\nengager antibody therapies but has also been reported with immunotherapies that target PD -1 \r\nor PD -L1 (Rotz et al. 2017; Adashek and Feldman 2019) ,  including atezo lizumab.  \r\nThere may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS ,  and in recognition of \r\nthe challenges in clinically distinguishing between the two ,  consolidated guidelines for medical \r\nmanagement of IRRs and CRS are provided in Table 7 .   \r\nTable 7 Management Guidelines for Infusion -Related Reactions and \r\nCytokine -Release Syndrome  \r\nEvent   Management  \r\nGrade 1 a \r\nFever b with or \r\nwithout  \r\nconstitutional \r\nsymptoms  \r\n \r\n \r\n Immediately interrupt infusion.  \r\nUpon symptom resolution ,  wait for 30 minutes and then restart infusion at half \r\nthe rate being given at the time of event onset.  \r\nIf the infusion is tolerated at the reduced rate for 30 minutes ,  the infusion \r\nrate may be increased to the original rate.  \r\n \r\n  If symptoms recur ,  discontinue infusion of this dose.  \r\n \r\n  Administer symptomatic treatment ,  c including maintenance of IV fluids for \r\nhydration.

NCI \r\nCTCAE v4.0 should be used when reporting severity of IRRs ,  CRS ,  or organ toxicities associated with \r\nCRS on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Org an toxicities associated with CRS should not influence overall \r\nCRS grading.  \r\nb Fever is defined as temperature \r\n 38\r\nC not attributable to any other cause.  In patients who develop \r\nCRS and then receive anti -pyretic ,  anti -cytokine ,  or corticosteroid therapy ,  fev er is no longer required \r\nwhen subsequently determining event severity (grade).  In this case ,  the grade is driven by the presence \r\nof hypotension and/or hypoxia.  \r\nc Symptomatic treatment may include oral or IV antihistamines ,  anti -pyretics ,  analgesics ,  \r\nbroncho dilators ,  and/or oxygen.  For bronchospasm ,  urticaria ,  or dyspnea ,  additional treatment may be \r\nadministered as per institutional practice.  \r\nd Low flow is defined as oxygen delivered at \r\n 6 L/min ,  and high flow is defined as oxygen delivered at \r\n 6 \r\nL/min.  \r\ne Resump tion of atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving benefit and have fully \r\nrecovered from the event.  Patients can be re -challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been \r\ndocumented by both the investigator (or an appropriate delega te) and the Medical Monitor.  For \r\nsubsequent infusions ,  administer oral premedication with antihistamines ,  anti -pyretics ,  and/or \r\nanalgesics ,  and monitor closely for IRRs and/or CRS.  Premedication with corticosteroids and \r\nextending the infusion time may al so be considered after consulting the Medical Monitor and \r\nconsidering the benefit\r\n risk ratio. f Refer to Riegler et al.
